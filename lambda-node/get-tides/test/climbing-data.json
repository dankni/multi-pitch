    "intro": "The East Ridge of Great Tor offers easy climbing right above the beach of Three Cliffs Bay. The route is non-tidal, but approaching from the beach is only possible at low tide. A not so straightforward scramble down or abseil from a nearby block are alternative options for reaching the base of the climb. The route is broken up by 3 significant ledges. Although it’s set as 4 pitches, linking pitch 2 and 3 or even 3 and 4 makes the pitches a bit more significant. There are also some variations that up the difficulty to Very Severe, although the variations avoids the dramatic south east edge overlooking the beaches and sea. Although Great Tor is the most significant multi-pitch climb in the area, the nearby 3 cliffs bay has a multitude of shorter trad climbs.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>:<br />\r\nFrom the National Trust Car Park at Penmaen (postcode: SA3 2HH), head back to the main road, turn right up the hill, then cross over to the smaller parking area and bus stop. Through the gate, follow the path towards Three Cliffs Bay. <br />\r\n<strong>Option A – Abseil & Scramble Down</strong>:<br />\r\nTake the first right at the fork in the path, then at the next fork take the left. Follow the path west along the coast until it heads out towards Great Tor. Before scrambling up onto the Tor proper (tor = rocky peak), there is a large block, that at the time of writing, was suitable for a gearless & retrievable abseil. This may be the most appropriate option if the grass is wet and the tide is in. 50m of abseil reaches the rocky ledges. From there, it’s possible to scramble across to the base of the climb.<br />\r\n<strong>Option B –  Low Tide Beach Approach</strong>:<br />\r\nTake the left at the first fork in the path and head down, all the way down to Three Cliffs Bay beach.  Keep to the right side of the beach, following it all the way to the base of Great Tor and scramble up to the non-tidal start of the route. <em>The tide has to be at it's lowest for this option.</em><br />\r\n<strong>Option C –  Scramble Down</strong>:<br />\r\nFollow the instructions of option A, but carry on over the first outcrop until the gully between the two peaks. From here it’s possible to scramble down carefully to the base of the climb. Not recommended un-roped in wet conditions. <br />\r\n<br /><strong>Descent</strong>:<br />\r\nScramble off the Tor to the North, following the worn path down into the gully then back up and out, onto the foot path. Take care on the polished limestone.",
    "pitchInfo": "Great Tor is a limestone tower that divides Three Cliffs Bay to the East from Oxwich Bay to the West. The Tor rises out of the sand between these beaches and can be climbed on all faces. While steep in places, the holds are usually plentiful and solid.

    "intro": "The Original Route up The Old Man of Hoy is a classic climb amongst classic climbs. Originally climbed in 1966 by Rusty Baillie, Chris Bonington and Tom Patey, this iconic multi-pitch has been the centre of some of the most focused media attention around climbing in the late 1990’s. The route climbs the east landward face, of this northern Scottish sandstone stack. It’s technically not a sea stack (because it’s attached to the mainland), but is usually referred to as such. The route requires a mix of technical climbing, including a short down climb, a traverse, as well as crack climbing and bridging skills. The route is made harder by nesting Fulmars who don’t like climbers around their nests. Descent from the top requires abseiling back down the route. The Original Route is listed in Ken Wilsons Hard Rock book, sitting alongside other UK classics in the <abbr title=\"Very Severe\">HVS</abbr> to <abbr title=\"Extremely Severe\">E1</abbr> range. The route has seen some incredible accents over the years, including being climbed by Red Szell as the first blind man to climb up The Old Man of Hoy. In more recent years Jesse Dufton, also blind, went one step further and climbed it on lead. Chris Bonington also made recent repeat of this stack while in his 80’s, over 50 years after his first accent, he climbed the stack with Leo Holding. The climb was originally graded HVS, but most recent guidebooks list it as E1. Although some pitches are straightforward, it would be easy to underestimate the complexity of getting up and back down safely. The exposure is incredible.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>: Head up the hill behind Rackwick Hostel until reaching the cottage at the top from which a well-constructed path will lead to the viewing promontory across from the Old Man of Hoy. Head North 120m from here and take the small well-worn path down to the rubble scramble to the stack at the base. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: There are two options for descent. The first is to abseil each pitch. Typically, there will be slings left behind to rap from at each anchor point. The climber should come prepared to replace them if they are not in a suitable condition. There is also sometimes a rope in situ to help with the pitch two traverse. If the party is not using 60m ropes, and there is not a rope in situ on pitch two, then climbers should be prepared to leave a spare rope behind on ascent, in order to facilitate the descent here. Alternatively, if the party is using a pair of 60m ropes, these can be used to rappel to the end of pitch 3. Then a short rappel to the end of pitch two. Then a longer rappel, free hanging, should take the climbers to the base of the stack. It should go without saying, but climbers should have a pair of prusik cords during the abseil. One to back up the abseil, the other in case the climber needs to ascend the rope for some reason.",

Pink Lady and Real Men wear Pink are nearby <abbr title=\"Very Severe\">VS</abbr> climbs. Sir Chris Bonington’s climb, Black Beauty offers an exceptional E1 climb further down the crag. Routes from the Lower Eagle Crag can also be linked up with routes on the shorter Upper Eagle Crag for extended adventures. The route Donkey Serenades covered here, weaves its way up the north facing slabs, making use of the natural breaks and slopes in the rock to reach the top. There is little technical difficulty (depending of which line you take), but it does require solid mountaineering experience because all anchors need to be built from trad gear. Many of the pitches will be in the shade until later in the afternoon, giving a shadier option if you want to avoid the worst of the Morocco sun.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>: Park on the main rout outside Anamr village, which sits under <a href=\"/climbs/east-buttress-on-ksar-rock/\">Ksar Rock</a>. From here walk back along the road before cutting across a vague track to the base of the mountain. Follow the wall all the way to the climb. The climb can be hard so spot the start of from the undergrowth.

    "pitchInfo": "Donkey Serenades takes the easiest line and obvious sweeping weakness up the more prominent part of the Lower Eagle Crag buttress. There are two possible starts and two different finishes depending which guidebook you use. The Oxford Alpine Club guide takes the easier start, which follows the first pitch of Pink Lady.

The route takes the left side of the pillar and moves around to finish on the large ledge system. However, the climber could take the crack on the right side of the pillar in two pitches to follow Pink Lady graded <abbr title=\"Very Severe\">VS</abbr> 4c. Alternatively the vegetated corner further right sill, follows the Real Men Wear Pink route, also VS. An additional option is to take the clean slab between these two VS lines for some exceptional climbing, with some decent gear options (not graded but also feels like VS). \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />\r\nFollow the right side of the broken slab above the party time belay ledge until reaching a steeper slab covered in black moss, usually in the shadow of the headwall. Build a traditional belay here.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nHead up and slightly left on the black mossy slab. There are lots of options for climbing this wall. When approaching the top, look for one of the vertical blocks.

The climber can follow the low-level crack higher up on the wall, or walk on a lower section. It’s possible to make this into a longer pitch. The 3 pitches (this pitch and the following 2 pitches) can be linked into 2 longer ones if required or if the climbers are short of time. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 6 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nFollow the steeper right, shady side of the next face.

The Morocco Rock guide suggests the climber should take the right grove around the right side of the pinnacle to reach the broken scramble above. A third option is to tackle the pinnacle directly for a much harder but much more impressive finish. The rock looks loose and very steep from below, but upon attacking the pinnacle directly the climber will be surprised to find the rock is solid and there are a number of good stances from which protection can be placed. The Donkey Direct finish is not listed in the guides but is likely not harder than VS and will offer the best possible end to the route if the climber is feeling unchallenged by the climbing up to that point. After building a belay on the ledges above to bring up the last of the party, then the climbers can scramble up to the summit paths without difficulty.",

    "intro": "High Sierra is situated on one of Tafraout’s granite domes, not far from the locally famous Napoleons Hat rock. Tafraout granite was formed from slow cooling lava and as a result, it has a very coarse crystalline structure. The rock is also surprisingly brittle in places where it looks solid. This makes an interesting change from the nearby quartzite rock, which looks loose but is generally very solid. Although not a pure trad line thanks to a bolted start and bolted finish, the crack system in the middle two pitches offers exceptional traditional climbing. This popular route is a great option if there is bad weather on the Jebel el Kest mountains. As a south facing route, it’s possible to literally watch the granite dry over a 30miniute period after heavy rain. The start is disproportionately harder than the rest of the route.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>: The approach to the High Sierra Dome is a straightforward walk from the &quot;car park&quot;. Drive into and through the village of Aguerd Oudad, under Napoleon’s Hat. Follow a dirt path out of the back of the village until you see the High Sierra Dome on the right. The climb can be approached directly with a scramble on the boulders to gain the base of the climb. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: Upon reaching the summit boulder, abseil back to the main plateau. Whilst it’s possible to lower off of the malion, the climber’s rope will undoubtably have picked up a lot of fine granite dust and sand along the route, meaning that running the weighted rope though the malion when lowering off, will wear through the metal (and damage your rope) faster. This will mean both need replacing more frequently. When abseiling, the rope sits statically on the malion reducing wear. From the plateau, walk east and behind the summit boulder. i.e. from the end of the abseil, turn to face the 3rd pitch anchor and walk forwards and left around the summit boulder. From here the climber walks past an incredible boulder shaped like the letter n. The climber carries onto the back of the plateau and walks of to the left (West) side to scramble down and back around.",
    "pitchInfo": "The route is described as esoteric in some guides for good reason. The first few moves of the climb require friction stepping, on steep rock with very few and very small handholds. It can seem outrageously hard for the technical grade of 5a. These first moves are unlikely to get easier as the route weathers years of climber’s feet, that said the sticky rubber of climbing shoes adheres to the granite in a way that defies sense. The first pitch can be avoided by approaching from further left or aided using the two starting bolts. After this the climb then offers a wonderful undercut pitch that is reminiscent of <a href=\"/climbs/doorpost-on-bosigran/\">Doorpost’s first pitch at Bosigran</a>, only bigger and longer. The third pitch offers some initial friction climbing that leads to an incredible and rather unique waist height flake. The final pitch is a short climb onto the nearby summit boulders. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">5a</span></strong><br />Climb the block right the right corner to gain a left sloping ramp. Walk along this ramp to the first bolt. Make the aforementioned hard moves, relying on small holds for both hands and feet. After a couple of tricky moves onto the block the second bolt can be clipped. From here the route moves up and right to increasingly better holds, with some options for gear placements at the top of the slab. From there move onto the right block then left to the bolted anchor. Alternatively, the climber can move past the bolted anchor onto the ledge and create a quick traditional anchor in the start of the second pitch using the crack system and nearby wedged blocks. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br />Climb the exceptional sloping crack using mostly undercuts all the way around the corner to a traditional gear belay in the corner before the rising flake of the 3rd pitch. Large cams are particularly helpful for protecting this pitch. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">45m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />Some delicate friction-based climbing on the low angle slab takes the climber to a bolt. Moving up from here a large flake can be used to comfortably move up the slab. Slings on the granite spikes on the top an edge of the flake can offer some additional protection as the climber moves up. The are also some options for gear higher in the giant flake. As the flake moves right the climber can pull up and slightly left onto the flake where there is a single bolt. From here the climber moves up to a crack then a bolted anchor. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br />From the previous anchor move onto the large plateau. There will be a large boulder with 2 additional smaller boulders on it, one of which has the summit boulder on top. Climb the large wall of the main boulder using the 3 bolts for protection. From here there is easier climbing to the summit boulder and its 2 anchor bolts with an abseil malion. Reaching this is a little runout. From the summit the climbers can abseil back to the plateau and walk off. Whilst there should be a malion on the summit anchor, carrying a spare one would be prudent.",

    "pitchInfo": "The East Buttress climb gets a mixture of sun and shade depending on the time of day and depending on what part of the crag the climber is on as the route weaves back and forth between the east and south faces. This route offers a little of everything but the technical difficulty goes up and down considerably from pitch to pitch. Linking pitch one and two together through the use of long runners will make a for a better first belay and a more logical route given the comparatively easy climbing on these pitches. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">20m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br /> Climb up the stepped slabs. With a good rack, a belay can be build on the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> ledge. Alternatively, moving all the way to the top ledge i.e. the end of ptch two, which is at the base of the crack on the east wall is a good option. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">20m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />If you haven’t linked this pitch, continue up the blocky slabs, taking the steeper right side of the final block, until you reach a belay at the base of the hand crack on the east wall. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">20m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />Here the route takes a significant jump in technical difficulty with a short jamming crack. At the top of the crack you gain a ledge, from there take the right hand (east) corner of the large block. This gives way to another ledge where a belay can be made under the significant steepening wall. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />Move left along the ledge to an obvious gully.

This popular route was climbed, or perhaps more accurately \"walked\", feet only by Jonny Dawes in 2017. Although Lundy (meaning Puffin Island in Norse) has climbing restrictions some of the year, the devils slide and a number of other areas are exempt. The slide doesn't have nesting birds, likely because it's so exposed, bare that in mind when you plan. To get to Lundy a ferry can be taken from Ilfracombe in Devon.

Techniques like simul climbing or scrambling allow parties to move much faster, reducing the risk of benightment, but increasing the type and impact of potential falls. Plan according to the parties strengths & weaknesses. The route was first climbed in 1887 by a party of climbers Bettega, Compton, Martin, Schulz. Parts of the climb are delicate, exposed and in places quite steep.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>: Approaches start in Val Gardena Many parties will go to the Fermeda Hütte or the nearby Rifugio Firenze in Cisles, which can be reached from the Col Raiser (chair-lift from St. Christina). From the huts follow the path to the Mittags-Scharte / Sass Rigais (marked) until you can reach the base of the Grosse/Gran Fermeda easily. From there it's a short walk to the beginning of the different routes.  <br />\r\nAn excellent approach for doing the climbs in one day is to take the Furnes - Seceda lift from St. Ulrich.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent A</strong>: The way down requires the climbers to revers the entire normal route, abseiling the harder sections. First climb down to the belay at the top of pitch 15, then make a short abseil past the 20m crux of the route. Keep descending to just below the short chimney of pitch 7, for here descend directly below the bolt to an anchor. Make a 25m abseil into the initial gully. Make a final 25m abseil down the gully then continue scrambling down the easier sections of the route to the base. <br /><br />\r\n<strong>Descent B</strong>: The alternative way down does more abseiling and less scrambling. Start by reversing the route to the saddle below the summit (~2 pitches), this is where the normal route joins the Southeast Ridge route. From this abseil station you can make 9 abseils of 20 to 25m each. Less if you have a 60m rope and skip stations. These go down the Northe East side of Grande Fermeda towards Odla de Cidles. From here decend the gully rightwards to a large chockstone, and make a 30m abseil (or a 10m and 20m abseil if using a single rope) move right and make one final 40m abseil (again 15m and 25m if using single ropes).

The route then continues up and over the broken ledge covered in grass, bilberry bushes and heather. This section is both hard to climb and hard to protect. It’s possible to use an ice axe to help climb the turf, however the small benefit and safety gained by taking an ice axe is outweighed but the inconvenience of carrying it on the following pitches. After the ledge, you can make a move up onto a ledge in the corner to build an anchor. This will be at more or less a full 50m rope length. The rope drag can be significant over the grass which is exactly where you don’t want it.

    "intro": "Morpheus is an enjoyable and varied multi-pitch climb originally graded Hard Very Difficult. The climb starts at the same point as Gronk on the left-hand part of the Sea Walls main area in Avon Gorge. Because it’s partially quarried limestone, the route offers and mix of climbing styles including moves on large crimps, laybacks on a flake, some delicate sloping moves and no doubt at least one mantle onto one of the many ledges. Protection is good and requires mostly wires, but some cams are also useful. Whilst the crux was originally the moves off the ground at the start, recent ecperiance suggest the corner crack on the 3rd pitch is now much harder. This is because the limited footholds have been polished to a glass like texture by the feet of many thousand climbers. The rest of the route is mostly not too polished. The Sea Walls at Avon Gorge are a real city crag and some of the most accessible multi-pitch rock climbing in the UK because you can park right at the cliff. However the disadvantage is the main road that runs below the crag is very noisy and can make verbal communication difficult on this climb.",
    "approach": "<strong>Approach</strong>: The easiest option is to park in the Sea Walls free car park directly below the cliff (51.468013, -2.632912).

It’s also possible to park above the cliff and climb the fence to gain the path down.</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: To descend you can follow the path back down (assuming you parked at the bottom) to the car. The path is obvious and leads to the main road just right of the Sea Walls climbing area in Avon Gorge, Bristol.",
    "pitchInfo": "The climb Morpheus takes a diagonal but weaving line up some of the easiest rock on the Sea Walls.  It makes for a great introduction to multipitch climbing due to plentiful ledge systems and a reasonably amenable grade (Hard Very Difficult / Severe). It’s possible to link the first two pitches into one long pitch providing you manage rope drag by extending runners and have a good level of confidence on the rock.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">28m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb the short wall to a ledge with some better gear options. The initial wall does have some good holds, but they are well disguised in the limestone. Once on the first ledge, carefully walk right to a blocky corner. Place gear and move up this a little, before cutting back left. The next belay is a crack on the left side of the white stained block. It allows good protection behind it. \r\n<br /><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">16m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb the block either by layback or reaching up and over while moving the feet up. From above the block move slightly right to good holds and climb onto one smaller ledge before moving up to a large ledge with some broken blocks below a corners system with a crack running through it. A belay can be created in the crack below the corner. \r\n<br /><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">10m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nOriginally not a graded pitch, years of climber’s feet have polished the stone here to make it arguably the hardest part of Morpheus whichever way you climb it. The original route suggests moving up the corner to the piton then moving out to the right before going up to the next belay. Whilst arguably still the easiest option, the move requires the climber to trust their feet on a highly polished hold where the foot slipping mid move could lead to an awkward fall. The alternative is to climb the corner directly. This means harder moves, especially for the shorter climber, however it feels much less exposed in the corner. Once this section is dealt with there are a couple of easy moves up onto a ledge with a stone seat and decent options for an anchor in the wall behind.\r\n<br /><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">12m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3b</span></strong><br />\r\nThis pitch is much easier than it looks. Take good holds diagonally right, initially passing a under a small bush. A belay can be made at the end of the climbing. Alternatively, there is a good tree belay around the corner, however verbal communication with your partner here will be impossible. <br />\r\nIt’s a short scramble up the back wall and a walk off after the tree belay point.",

    "intro": "This is a huge climb set quite a long walk from civilisation. Technically it’s 3 climbs: Avalanche then Red Wall then Longlands Continuation. These routes  flow into each other with a number of variants. For example you could swap out Avalanche and Red Wall for The Sword & Route 2. This would up the grade to Very Severe thanks to the first pitch of The Sword. With everything that’s going on on Y Lliwedd, the route finding can be a challenge but most sections up the Eastern Buttress of the crag are not too high in grade. Mount Y Lliwedd (colourless peak in English) was where British mountaineers trained before making some of the first attempts to summit Everest.",
    "approach": "<strong>Parking</strong>: If you arrive very early (due to limited spaced) and don’t mind the parking fees, Parking in Pen Y Pass is easiest. Otherwise there is some roadside parking just after the turn off away from Llanberis Pass, but this will increase the hike by up to 30mins each way. Alternatively, you can park in the Nant Perris car park and take a shuttle taxi up to Pen Y Pass (£2 each way per person in 2019). For this follow the signs for park and ride. <br />\r\n<strong>Approach</strong>: From Pen Y Pass, take the Miners track to the first lake and the green pump house. Turn left here towards Mount Y Lliwedd. Follow the path briefly then cut right and away from the main tracks towards the base of the mountain. <br />\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: If you head left after completing the climb (with the route behind you), this will take you to a path that leads off the summit and back to the main track. Allow up to 2 hours to get back to Pen Y Pass from the top of Lliwedd as the path weaves around the back of the mountain and you may well be pretty tired after the climb.",
    "pitchInfo": "A true mountain classic that features in all major North Wales guidebooks and the iconic Classic Rock book by Ken Wilson. Allow plenty of time for route finding on the 12 pitches. Most of the climbing is technically straightforward with an reasonably exposed 4a pitch on the Red Wall section that’s very memorable and a crux 4b pitch right at the end which is a delicate slab with good but smaller spaced holds. 2 pitches are a short walk along a ledge so some time can be saved there. Allowing 12 hours for a round trip from Pen Y Pass would be sensible. It can be done much quicker, especially if you know the route, however it could also take much longer if you get lost so bringing a decent headtorch is a good idea. The route is North facing, so will be in the shade most of the day, this means it can take a couple of good days to dry out. Climbing it damp will be much harder and less enjoyable. The route has been given the grade Hard Very Difficult or HVD in older guides and Severe in the newer rockFax. Protection is mostly good, but being able to confidently and easily climb severe 4b is essential as there are not many easy escape options. J. Longland added his continuation to the Redwall in 1929. Where grades are shown as 3c I’m simply marking that it’s rock climbing of low technical difficulty by modern standards. This is simply to distinguish between climbing pitches and walking or scrambling pitches. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nThe first pitch goes up to the heather shelf from the base. Follow a steep curving groove to the right hand side of the shelf. If you are worried about timing you can scramble up the side and essentially skip this pitch. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nNot an obvious line and one it’s easy to get lost on. The key is to move diagonally right below a heather bush and over 2 ribs of rock, then climb up just under 5m to belay left of a spike. Moving over only one rib will lead you up a steeper gully with some harder moves. You can climb out of this at the top and back down into the correct path if you do get lost. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up a short pitch to belay on a ledge just left of a quartz band running though some rock to your right. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up and diagonally right via the quartz band to get over the buldge. Climb the right hand side of the rib to a spike belay.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 5 –<span class=\"length\">35m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nA straightforward pitch that goes broadly straight up to a ledge that marks the end of climbing for the route Avalance. You can belay on a reasonably square spike or move further right to a slightly higher ledge to belay from cracks in the wall.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 6 –<span class=\"length\">32m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />\r\nWalk / Scramble up and right keeping reasonably close to the main wall, until you get to the redwall with RW etched into it in big letters. You can create a belay here before taking on the magical redwall pitch. Alternatively, there is an escape option leftwards to the terminal arete which will be easier climbing / scrambling to the top (so guidebooks say).\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 7 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nTo lead the redwall you take a beautiful rising traverse on delicate holds. Cams and some nuts can be used to protect the moves in a few places. The exposed moves take you onto a rib which you can move up though to some ledges and eventually a belay in a groove leaning towards the terminal arete (up and left). \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 8 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nContinue up passing a pinnacle on the right. From the ledge you want to use a short wall to climb on to the grassy ledge called the Green Gallery. There are some belay options either on the left or on the centre of this ledge. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 9 –<span class=\"length\">10m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />\r\nWalk towards the edge of the ledge at the right. You can either create a new belay here or link this into the next pitch as one. If you are linking these up then make sure you use a long runner and ideally a carabineer with a wheel like the DMM Revolver. If in doubt don’t run them together or the rope drag will take the fun out of the climb and you risk a ground / ledge fall.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 10 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nIf you end up climbing an awkward but enjoyable chimney, chances are you left the ledge in the wrong place and may find the route slightly more difficult. The route is supposed to climb the left arete off of the right side of the Green Gallery, heading up and leftwards to some ledges and a slab. Move up past a broken block and create a belay in a pocket further up.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 11 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nMove up and rightwards directly towards the final slab of Longlands continuation. You should see or at least hear walkers on the summit by this point. A belay can be created on the ledge directly below the final slab. The multi-pitch climb is coming to an end but the hardest pitch remains.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 12 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br />\r\nThe final pitch moves up and trends slightly left in before going straight to the summit of Lliwedd’s Eastern Buttress. The gear is good if you take the time to find it and delicate footwork will help see you thought. The rock is clean and generally solid. There are a number of belay options on the summit.",

Cross two fields and turn right at the cliff edge. Follow the coastal path until you see Cornakey Cliff. When above it, pass behind it to a sketchy and thorny scramble down the slope. Reach the loose rib and work your way down to the makeshift hut. Pass that to the (hopefully) in-situ rope. Descend to sea level when the tide is out and make your way around to the base of the climb. This may require some rock hopping or down climbing. Don't forget to enjoy the descent, it's part of the experience.",
    "pitchInfo": "It's fair to say everyone has a slightly different experience on wreckers slab, partly because the cliff is loose and the holds likely change regularly, even between the leader and the second! This makes helmets an absolute must. Due to its scale it's likely a lot of people also take slightly different lines, especially at the bottom and top pitches where the route is less clear. I think it justifies the grade of VS 4b. With the low technical grade it's an easy route to underestimate. A lot of the protection early on is marginal and some placements could actually make the climb more dangerous. For instance, a cam behind a large loose block could put the seconds life in danger. In short, it's not an ideal choice for those new to traditional multi-pitch climbing, but it offers stunning views and is a wonderful lengthy adventure if you have the experience lead it.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nMy experience here is reasonably worthless except to say if you leave the guidebook at the top of the cliff (because who wants to climb with a guide book in their bag), then the chances are you won’t actually know exactly which way to go and may attack the first belay head on. This takes you over loose ground with little or no gear and possibly makes the route a harder grade. Instead I’d recommend you don’t start too far right, climb up a few of meters to where the cliff eases off then traverse all the way left to the arete and head up to the belay.\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 2 pegs that you can use to form part of your belay. I’d highly recommend a 3 or 4 point anchor in addition to them. I placed my gear below the pegs giving a reasonably comfy ledge to belay from. Your nut tool comes in handy to clean the cracks when you lead this pitch!\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 – <span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4b</span></strong><br />\r\nHead up and around the overhanging block just above the belay. Whilst this is probably the steepest part of the climb it’s not fully vertical making gear placements easier than it looks. Be careful not to throw too many handholds at the belay below and follow the reasonably obvious crack up to a big grassy ledge with a pillar of rock on it.  There are lots of options to build a traditional anchor here. You can use the front of the pillar, side or even the nearby crack further up.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 – <span class=\"length\">50m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nThis is where the rock climbing becomes utterly enjoyable. For the most part the rock is solid and there are plenty of placements for gear, the left ridge is recommended with its stunning if a little intense views. Guidebooks suggest the pitch is 45m, but a the full 50m will take you over the top and right a little. A good belay can be built on the other side of the top ridge. Consider belaying your partner off the top 10m walk. It would be a stretch to call it a 4th pitch, but placing a couple of pieces of gear makes it a safer scramble.",

Most of the harder moves are protected by old bolts. You will need a full trad rack of nuts and cams. Tri cams are particularly helpful for the pockets. The last pitch has no fixed protection. The route is given f5c in some guides or UIAA V+ in others, it is hard to convert to British grades but given the protection is good at the harder sections, the British grade of VS 5a (maybe HVS 5b) seems best. If anything feels hard, take some time and search for better holds, there will be some. The descent requires 3 abseils of 40m, 40m and just under 60m.",
    "approach": "Park in the lower parking lot of Vinya Nova (41.585600, 1.816281). From there take the path north into the forest towards Torrent del Pont. Advance through the torrent and shortly after follow the path that goes to the right (milestones and white marks). Follow this uphill and arrive at a turnoff, head north. Pass by the foot of Pollegó de la Vinya Nova. Continue to the base of the Gray Rock.<br /><br />\r\nThe descent requires 3 abseils of 40m, 40m and just under 60m. To find the anchor to abseil you need to walk along the ridge for 80m. You go over a couple of small peaks. You may want to stay roped for this slinging the occasional bush as the ground can be loose. If you use a pair of 50m ropes you can either use a tree to break the last abseil into 2 or create a trad anchor on the way or even abseil carefully off the end of the rope and downclimb the last 10m. All these options have risk especially if you end up doing it in the dark.",
    "pitchInfo": "This route is a stunning mixed protection multi-pitch rock climb. Because it’s an absolute classic it can be popular, even out of season. The climb is interesting and sustained, with a mixture of delicate slab work and a few big moves on a steep wall on the 3rd pitch. The views are incredible looking out over the valley and the exposure is immense in places.  Especially where the climb moves between the spires, up the middle of the 4th pitch and the travers across a ledge on the 5th pitch. The route could be climbed clean without use of the bolts if you have the confidence, time, patience and stamina to find protection on the slab sections which can be quite blank. It’s quicker and likely more enjoyable if you climb the route mixed, using the in-situ bolts with additional gear to protect the run out sections on the 1st, 4th and 5th pitches and protection for the <em>entire</em> 6th pitch. A set of cams, nuts and tri-cams should cover you. Larger pieces could be helpful on the last pitch. 50m ropes are enough to get to the top, but 60m ropes are needed for the decent to save down climbing the last abseil or using a tree / bush for the last part. The rock can be loose, especially on pitch 1. Loose rocks also tend to gather on the ledges, so make sure you wear helmet and try to avoid dislodging rock onto the path below which can be popular with hikers, who won’t have helmets! All the belay points have 3 expansion bolts which can be used for the anchors, except the top of the route where you will need to sling a bush or two and make sure you are not belaying more weight up than can be comfortably held. If climbing as a 3, it would be safer to belay the 2nd and 3rd climber separately on this pitch.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">35m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">IV+</span></strong><br />\r\nThe first pitch moves up to some trees on the ledge then left onto the ridge and directly up the centre of the slab spire to the belay. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">V</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up the spire to some harder moves not long after the belay. These are well protected by bolts and pitons. This pitch then eases off near the top to a belay behind the next spire.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">V+</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb the steep face using the big pockets which make for jug sized hand holds. Follow the bolts up onto the summit of this little spire and find the anchor in the gap between the next spire. This pitch is a quite different in style to the others, so although the crux on paper it may feel easy to someone comfortable with bouldering, or particularly tough if you normally stick to slabs.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">50m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">V</span></strong><br />\r\nA long, exposed climb up the largest spire. Harder moves early on that change into a lower angled slab with no bolts and limited protection options.  The anchor is to the right near where this spire joins the next. Don’t climb to the top of this spire. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 5 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">IV</span></strong><br />\r\nThe is a single bolt on this pitch and no clear path to the next anchor. Moving up to a ledge and wall offers good hand holds and some pockets for protection, before a traverse right to the anchor. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 6 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">IV+</span></strong><br />\r\nMove straight up following the crack system. There is no fixed protection but a number of placements can be found. Move over a small ledge to the summit. This is a sustained pitch of UIAA grave IV or IV+ all the way. There are no bolts at the top so you will need to sling a bush or two and make sure you are not belaying more weight up than can be comfortably held. If climbing as a 3, it would be safer to belay the 2nd and 3rd climber separately on this pitch.",
