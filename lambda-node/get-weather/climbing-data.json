The South Pilar route or Sydpillaren, offers some challenging climbing, especially towards the top with a couple of N6- graded pitches which roughly equate to HVS/E1. In total it’s a 14 pitch climb that is described as one of Norway’s finest climbs and it’s a classic alpine test piece. Getting down actually requires reversing the Original Route (graded n4),  it will require ropework in sections.",

Make sure you wait for a dry period to tackle this climb or you will have to deal with seepage or potentially a full on waterfall, especially on the higher pitches across the black streak. For those up to the challenge the Dibona Upper Wall provides the logical continuation.

Carrying extra gear and bringing longer ropes could speed up the climb but it’s certainly not essential. The rock is generally very solid with excellent friction but like all large mountain slabs there will be some loose rock in places. \r\n\r\nThe new guidebook Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West, grades the route 5.8. but if needed it’s possible to avoid any challenging bits by traversing into the slab. This drops the grade a little. It’s often considered 5.6 on the YDS scale which is somewhere around Severe or Hard Severe.",

    "intro": "This is a huge climb set quite a long walk from civilisation. Technically it’s 3 climbs: Avalanche then Red Wall then Longlands Continuation. These routes  flow into each other with a number of variants. For example you could swap out Avalanche and Red Wall for The Sword & Route 2. This would up the grade to Very Severe thanks to the first pitch of The Sword. With everything that’s going on on Y Lliwedd, the route finding can be a challenge but most sections up the Eastern Buttress of the crag are not too high in grade. Mount Y Lliwedd (colourless peak in English) was where British mountaineers trained before making some of the first attempts to summit Everest.",
    "approach": "<strong>Parking</strong>: If you arrive very early (due to limited spaced) and don’t mind the parking fees, Parking in Pen Y Pass is easiest. Otherwise there is some roadside parking just after the turn off away from Llanberis Pass, but this will increase the hike by up to 30mins each way. Alternatively, you can park in the Nant Perris car park and take a shuttle taxi up to Pen Y Pass (£2 each way per person in 2019). For this follow the signs for park and ride. <br />\r\n<strong>Approach</strong>: From Pen Y Pass, take the Miners track to the first lake and the green pump house. Turn left here towards Mount Y Lliwedd. Follow the path briefly then cut right and away from the main tracks towards the base of the mountain. <br />\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: If you head left after completing the climb (with the route behind you), this will take you to a path that leads off the summit and back to the main track. Allow up to 2 hours to get back to Pen Y Pass from the top of Lliwedd as the path weaves around the back of the mountain and you may well be pretty tired after the climb.",
    "pitchInfo": "A true mountain classic that features in all major North Wales guidebooks and the iconic Classic Rock book by Ken Wilson. Allow plenty of time for route finding on the 12 pitches. Most of the climbing is technically straightforward with an reasonably exposed 4a pitch on the Red Wall section that’s very memorable and a crux 4b pitch right at the end which is a delicate slab with good but smaller spaced holds. 2 pitches are a short walk along a ledge so some time can be saved there. Allowing 12 hours for a round trip from Pen Y Pass would be sensible. It can be done much quicker, especially if you know the route, however it could also take much longer if you get lost so bringing a decent headtorch is a good idea. The route is North facing, so will be in the shade most of the day, this means it can take a couple of good days to dry out. Climbing it damp will be much harder and less enjoyable. The route has been given the grade Hard Very Difficult or HVD in older guides and Severe in the newer rockFax. Protection is mostly good, but being able to confidently and easily climb severe 4b is essential as there are not many easy escape options. J. Longland added his continuation to the Redwall in 1929. Where grades are shown as 3c I’m simply marking that it’s rock climbing of low technical difficulty by modern standards. This is simply to distinguish between climbing pitches and walking or scrambling pitches. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nThe first pitch goes up to the heather shelf from the base. Follow a steep curving groove to the right hand side of the shelf. If you are worried about timing you can scramble up the side and essentially skip this pitch. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nNot an obvious line and one it’s easy to get lost on. The key is to move diagonally right below a heather bush and over 2 ribs of rock, then climb up just under 5m to belay left of a spike. Moving over only one rib will lead you up a steeper gully with some harder moves. You can climb out of this at the top and back down into the correct path if you do get lost. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up a short pitch to belay on a ledge just left of a quartz band running though some rock to your right. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up and diagonally right via the quartz band to get over the buldge. Climb the right hand side of the rib to a spike belay.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 5 –<span class=\"length\">35m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nA straightforward pitch that goes broadly straight up to a ledge that marks the end of climbing for the route Avalance. You can belay on a reasonably square spike or move further right to a slightly higher ledge to belay from cracks in the wall.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 6 –<span class=\"length\">32m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />\r\nWalk / Scramble up and right keeping reasonably close to the main wall, until you get to the redwall with RW etched into it in big letters. You can create a belay here before taking on the magical redwall pitch. Alternatively, there is an escape option leftwards to the terminal arete which will be easier climbing / scrambling to the top (so guidebooks say).\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 7 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nTo lead the redwall you take a beautiful rising traverse on delicate holds. Cams and some nuts can be used to protect the moves in a few places. The exposed moves take you onto a rib which you can move up though to some ledges and eventually a belay in a groove leaning towards the terminal arete (up and left). \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 8 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nContinue up passing a pinnacle on the right. From the ledge you want to use a short wall to climb on to the grassy ledge called the Green Gallery. There are some belay options either on the left or on the centre of this ledge. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 9 –<span class=\"length\">10m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br />\r\nWalk towards the edge of the ledge at the right. You can either create a new belay here or link this into the next pitch as one. If you are linking these up then make sure you use a long runner and ideally a carabineer with a wheel like the DMM Revolver. If in doubt don’t run them together or the rope drag will take the fun out of the climb and you risk a ground / ledge fall.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 10 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nIf you end up climbing an awkward but enjoyable chimney, chances are you left the ledge in the wrong place and may find the route slightly more difficult. The route is supposed to climb the left arete off of the right side of the Green Gallery, heading up and leftwards to some ledges and a slab. Move up past a broken block and create a belay in a pocket further up.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 11 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nMove up and rightwards directly towards the final slab of Longlands continuation. You should see or at least hear walkers on the summit by this point. A belay can be created on the ledge directly below the final slab. The multi-pitch climb is coming to an end but the hardest pitch remains.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 12 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br />\r\nThe final pitch moves up and trends slightly left in before going straight to the summit of Lliwedd’s Eastern Buttress. The gear is good if you take the time to find it and delicate footwork will help see you thought. The rock is clean and generally solid. There are a number of belay options on the summit.",

Whilst described as a clean trad route in many guidebooks, Esparraguera has a good amount bolts (17) and pitons (2) in sections in the middle pitches. Most of the harder moves are protected by old bolts. You will need a full trad rack of nuts and cams. Tri cams are particularly helpful for the pockets. The last pitch has no fixed protection. The route is given f5c in some guides or UIAA V+ in others, it is hard to convert to British grades but given the protection is good at the harder sections, the British grade of VS 5a (maybe HVS 5b) seems best.

You may want to stay roped for this slinging the occasional bush as the ground can be loose. If you use a pair of 50m ropes you can either use a tree to break the last abseil into 2 or create a trad anchor on the way or even abseil carefully off the end of the rope and downclimb the last 10m. All these options have risk especially if you end up doing it in the dark.",
    "pitchInfo": "This route is a stunning mixed protection multi-pitch rock climb. Because it’s an absolute classic it can be popular, even out of season. The climb is interesting and sustained, with a mixture of delicate slab work and a few big moves on a steep wall on the 3rd pitch. The views are incredible looking out over the valley and the exposure is immense in places.  Especially where the climb moves between the spires, up the middle of the 4th pitch and the travers across a ledge on the 5th pitch. The route could be climbed clean without use of the bolts if you have the confidence, time, patience and stamina to find protection on the slab sections which can be quite blank. It’s quicker and likely more enjoyable if you climb the route mixed, using the in-situ bolts with additional gear to protect the run out sections on the 1st, 4th and 5th pitches and protection for the <em>entire</em> 6th pitch. A set of cams, nuts and tri-cams should cover you. Larger pieces could be helpful on the last pitch. 50m ropes are enough to get to the top, but 60m ropes are needed for the decent to save down climbing the last abseil or using a tree / bush for the last part. The rock can be loose, especially on pitch 1. Loose rocks also tend to gather on the ledges, so make sure you wear helmet and try to avoid dislodging rock onto the path below which can be popular with hikers, who won’t have helmets! All the belay points have 3 expansion bolts which can be used for the anchors, except the top of the route where you will need to sling a bush or two and make sure you are not belaying more weight up than can be comfortably held. If climbing as a 3, it would be safer to belay the 2nd and 3rd climber separately on this pitch.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">35m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">IV+</span></strong><br />\r\nThe first pitch moves up to some trees on the ledge then left onto the ridge and directly up the centre of the slab spire to the belay. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">V</span></strong><br />\r\nClimb up the spire to some harder moves not long after the belay. These are well protected by bolts and pitons.

Follow the bolts up onto the summit of this little spire and find the anchor in the gap between the next spire. This pitch is a quite different in style to the others, so although the crux on paper it may feel easy to someone comfortable with bouldering, or particularly tough if you normally stick to slabs.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">50m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade uiaa\">V</span></strong><br />\r\nA long, exposed climb up the largest spire. Harder moves early on that change into a lower angled slab with no bolts and limited protection options.  The anchor is to the right near where this spire joins the next.

There is no fixed protection but a number of placements can be found. Move over a small ledge to the summit. This is a sustained pitch of UIAA grave IV or IV+ all the way. There are no bolts at the top so you will need to sling a bush or two and make sure you are not belaying more weight up than can be comfortably held.

    "pitchInfo": "It's fair to say everyone has a slightly different experience on wreckers slab, partly because the cliff is loose and the holds likely change regularly, even between the leader and the second! This makes helmets an absolute must. Due to its scale it's likely a lot of people also take slightly different lines, especially at the bottom and top pitches where the route is less clear. I think it justifies the grade of VS 4b. With the low technical grade it's an easy route to underestimate. A lot of the protection early on is marginal and some placements could actually make the climb more dangerous. For instance, a cam behind a large loose block could put the seconds life in danger. In short, it's not an ideal choice for those new to traditional multi-pitch climbing, but it offers stunning views and is a wonderful lengthy adventure if you have the experience lead it.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nMy experience here is reasonably worthless except to say if you leave the guidebook at the top of the cliff (because who wants to climb with a guide book in their bag), then the chances are you won’t actually know exactly which way to go and may attack the first belay head on. This takes you over loose ground with little or no gear and possibly makes the route a harder grade. Instead I’d recommend you don’t start too far right, climb up a few of meters to where the cliff eases off then traverse all the way left to the arete and head up to the belay.\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 2 pegs that you can use to form part of your belay. I’d highly recommend a 3 or 4 point anchor in addition to them. I placed my gear below the pegs giving a reasonably comfy ledge to belay from. Your nut tool comes in handy to clean the cracks when you lead this pitch!\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 – <span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4b</span></strong><br />\r\nHead up and around the overhanging block just above the belay. Whilst this is probably the steepest part of the climb it’s not fully vertical making gear placements easier than it looks. Be careful not to throw too many handholds at the belay below and follow the reasonably obvious crack up to a big grassy ledge with a pillar of rock on it.  There are lots of options to build a traditional anchor here. You can use the front of the pillar, side or even the nearby crack further up.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 – <span class=\"length\">50m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nThis is where the rock climbing becomes utterly enjoyable. For the most part the rock is solid and there are plenty of placements for gear, the left ridge is recommended with its stunning if a little intense views. Guidebooks suggest the pitch is 45m, but a the full 50m will take you over the top and right a little. A good belay can be built on the other side of the top ridge. Consider belaying your partner off the top 10m walk. It would be a stretch to call it a 4th pitch, but placing a couple of pieces of gear makes it a safer scramble.",

    "intro": "The Keswick Brothers were some of the key early rock climbing pioneers. What is particularly important about them is fact they travelled with an camera making them some of the first people to capture rock climbing imagery. They set first accents up and down the UK including their first climb on Scafell Crag in 1897. Keswick Brother’s Climb takes a shorter line up the left side of the buttress over easy ground and up the grooved slab. If you have ever wondered why Very Difficult climbs are generally Very Easy, you need to understand the adjectival grading system used in Britain comes from the 1800’s. Climbers in that period didn’t have cams or even nuts. They didn’t have Kernmantle dynamic ropes or dedicated sticky rubber climbing shoes. In fact this climb was graded over 20 years before the carabiner was invented!",

    "intro": "Chair Ladder at Porthgwarra in Cornwall offers an exceptional range of climbing from the easier end of the scale but goes up to E3 for those looking for a challenge. Pegasus is one of the longer lines and sits at the Bulging Wall end of the crag. The route uses the corner crack at the start to ascend to the first belay, then weaves right to a belay in the corner, before going back left to the top. However there are multiple options for variation. There are also a varity of other lines on the crag that are 50m+ and range from VDiff to E3. South Face Direct is highly recomended.",
    "approach": "There is paid parking in Porthgwarra and a path that leads to the coastguard lookout which is directly above the sea cliff. There is an option to abseil in on the east side of the crag, or you can scramble down via the west side of Zwarn Rinny. This scramble down approach should be avoided at high tide.",

The rock is Torridonian sandstone, meaning it was formed before any significant life on earth existed. The approach is either some wet rock hopping 100m north of the stack at the lowest tide or the more classic Tyrolean traverse which needs to be set up by swimming the 8 meter channel if there is not one left in place when you arrive. The route itself, Original Route, meanders the landward face. Larger cams and hexs are recommended. Be wary of nesting seagulls who first line of defence is usually to attack you with projectile vomit.",
    "approach": "Park at the car park near the Stoer Light house (58.237948, -5.400902). Head 3Km northwards to the sea stack, going over the hill of Sidhean Mor. Take a steep scramble down and either boulder hop to the stack at the lowest of tides or set up a Tyrolean traverse if one is not in place already by swimming the 8 meter channel. Using a static rope for this will be easier than dynamic climbing ropes if you can be bothered to carry it.",
