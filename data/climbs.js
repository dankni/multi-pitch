The rock is Torridonian sandstone, meaning it was formed before any significant life on earth existed. The approach is either some wet rock hopping 100m north of the stack at the lowest tide or the more classic Tyrolean traverse which needs to be set up by swimming the 8 meter channel if there is not one left in place when you arrive. The route itself, Original Route, meanders the landward face. Larger cams and hexs are recommended. Be wary of nesting seagulls who first line of defence is usually to attack you with projectile vomit.",

Make sure you wait for a dry period to tackle this climb or you will have to deal with seepage or potentially a full on waterfall, especially on the higher pitches across the black streak. For those up to the challenge the Dibona Upper Wall provides the logical continuation.

Although Lundy (meaning Puffin Island in Norse) has climbing restrictions some of the year, the devils slide and a number of other areas are exempt.

It sits somewhere between VS and E1, but given the protection is good I have converted it to a HVS 5a which I think airs on the side of caution.

    "intro": "The Keswick Brothers were some of the key early rock climbing pioneers. What is particularly important about them is fact they travelled with an camera making them some of the first people to capture rock climbing imagery. They set first accents up and down the UK including their first climb on Scafell Crag in 1897. Keswick Brother’s Climb takes a shorter line up the left side of the buttress over easy ground and up the grooved slab. If you have ever wondered why Very Difficult climbs are generally Very Easy, you need to understand the adjectival grading system used in Britain comes from the 1800’s. Climbers in that period didn’t have cams or even nuts. They didn’t have Kernmantle dynamic ropes or dedicated sticky rubber climbing shoes. In fact this climb was graded over 20 years before the carabiner was invented!",

    "intro": "Joy follows the striking right facing dihedral corner up the Mt. Indefatigable slab offering around 300m of climbing. There is little to no fixed protection but plenty of opportunity for placements all the way. Belays can be made at various positions allowing pitches to be the full length of the rope. Carrying extra gear and bringing longer ropes could speed up the climb but it’s certainly not essential. The rock is generally very solid with excellent friction but like all large mountain slabs there will be some loose rock in places. \n\nThe new guidebook Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West, grades the route 5.8. but if needed it’s possible to avoid any challenging bits by traversing into the slab. This drops the grade a little. It’s often considered 5.6 on the YDS scale which is somewhere around Severe or Hard Severe.",
    "approach": "Hike across the dam and follow the main hikers trail that parallels he lake. Do not go up past the bear closure sign on the summit trail. The approach trail is pretty flat all the way to the scree slope when the route becomes very apparent. Don't follow any smaller offshoot trails that head downhill to the lakeshore, just follow the signs with hiker symbols on them. It's pretty straightforward. 25 minutes to scree slope from car. Head up the scree to the base of the route.",

Topcat swaps out the middle of this for a harder but reasonably well protected trad line graded HVS 5b. The views on this route are stunning and utterly unique in the world of climbing. Fun fact, Gwáilóu means Ghostly Man in Cantonese and is used to refer to white westerners.  Hong Kong can range from roasting hot with lots of mosquitos to typhoon season with howling winds so plan accordingly.",

Upon reaching a small shelter on the ridge line take the upper right hand path (signposted to Lion Rock) and continue upwards. When approximately level with the toe of the crag a small dirt path breaks off right from the main track (by a small platform and a ‘Danger - Steep Cliffs’ signpost) and leads to the foot of the cliff. Approach time approx. 40 minutes. Sha Tin side: Take the MTR to Sha Tin Station and get a taxi to Mong Fu Shek BBQ. From here follow the obvious footpath up the hill towards the crag. From the shelter follow the left hand path up the ridge and approach as for Kowloon side. Approach time approx. 45 minutes.",

Expect to have to follow other parties if you don’t start very early. With a 60m rope and some extended quickdraws the route can be reduced to 5 pitches if you are so inclined. Clearly a classic of the area the route also offers stunning views and reasonably serious climbing.",
