The rock is Torridonian sandstone, meaning it was formed before any significant life on earth existed. The approach is either some wet rock hopping 100m north of the stack at the lowest tide or the more classic Tyrolean traverse which needs to be set up by swimming the 8 meter channel if there is not one left in place when you arrive. The route itself â€œOriginal Routeâ€ meanders the landward face. Larger cams and hexs are recommended. Be wary of nesting seagulls who first line of defence is usually to attack you with projectile vomit.",
   "approach": "Park at the car park near the Stoer Light house (58.237948, -5.400902). Head 3Km northwards to the sea stack, going over the hill of Sidhean Mor. Take a steep scramble down and either boulder hop to the stack at the lowest of tides or set up a Tyrolean traverse if one is not in place already by swimming the 8 meter channel. Using a static rope for this will be easier than dynamic climbing ropes if you can be bothered to carry it.",

The climb weaves its way along the edges of the large black water steak that dominates the face. This water that comes heavy in wetter months, has shaped the rock in to lots of clean jugs making the accent surprisingly easy for the steep face. Make sure you wait for a dry period to tackle this climb or you will have to deal with seepage or potentially a full on waterfall, especially on the higher pitches across the black streak. For those up to the challenge the Dibona Upper Wall provides the logical continuation. Combining the routes gives almost a kilometre of climbing up one of the most impressive faces of the Dolomites whilst never exceeding grade IV+.",

Although Lundy (meaning Puffin Island in Norse) has climbing restrictions some of the year, the devils slide and a number of other areas are exempt. The slide doesnâ€™t have nesting birds, likely because it's so exposed, bare that in mind when you plan. To get to Lundy a ferry can be taken from Ilfracombe in Devon.

Cross two fields and turn right at the cliff edge. Follow the coastal path until you see Cornakey Cliff. When above it, pass behind it to a sketchy and thorny scramble down the slope.

That said you will need a full trad rack of nuts and cams etc. The route is given f5c in some guides or UIAA V+ in others, this makes it hard to convert to British grades. It sits somewhere between VS and E1, but given the protection is good I have converted it to a HVS 5a which I think airs on the side of caution.
