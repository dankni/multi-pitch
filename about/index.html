            <p>
			  When I led my first trad multi-pitch climb, it realised it 
			  required my mind and body to work together in a way that I 
			  just don't get to experience in everyday life or even sport climbing or bouldering. 
			  I had to overcome 
			  fear. I had to solve complex problems with ropes and gear. I had 
			  to make calculations about the risk of the decisions I was 
			  making for me and my climbing partners. My body was tested for
			  endurance and strength. In short it pushed my body physically 
			  and mentally. Big trad multipitch climbing makes me feel truly 
			  alive. It makes all the things it's so easy to worry about seem 
			  utterly inconsequential. 
            </p>
			<p>
              The un-bolted mountain is a part of the world not controlled by mankind. 
			  The mountain is king and I'm just a temporary trespasser. It doesn't 
			  care if I live or die, it doesn't care if I ascend the route or bail 
			  halfway through. I was climbing a route in the UK and I was 1 pitch from 
			  the top  and the gentle walk off, but was utterly exhausted, and 
			  not just a little frustrated. It was there I realised, there was 
			  no easy way out. No-one could help me, it was all on me to find 
			  out how much deeper I could dig because the easiest way to get 
			  down was to keep climbing up. In that situation my body found its 
			  flow and carried me to the top in a blur.
            </p>

			  My experiance is however, not unique. Al Alvarez shares a similar view.

            <h3>Why build multi-pitch.com?</h3>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
	      <div class="col">
            <p>
			  The main motivation to build multi-pitch.com comes from how difficult and 
			  expensive it is to plan great climbing trips.
			</p>
			<p>
			  About 1/4 of the UK live in the South East, including me. London is quite possibly the furthest city in the UK from any decent crag. Sure I'm partial to a Sandstone climb around Tonbridge, but once you've done traditional multi-pitch, everything else seems like child's play. So to get any real good climbing in, requires quite an excursion. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Although there are many useful websites out there like UKC or the mountain project, without 
			  exception they all focus on volume. The result is the quality of the information suffers. 
			  They are proud to list 100,000+ routes, but many don't have <em>any</em> information and most don't 
			  have any pictures, let along good imagery or topography. So unless you already have the guidebook 
			  they are not much use for planning. This means you have to buy guidebooks, lots of expensive 
			  guidebooks. These have the info you need but are also full of information you don't need. Sure 
			  it's great to see that E9 climb but I'm not going to try and climb it any time soon. I like my 
			  legs the way they are thank you very much. So you buy a dozen guidebooks but you still have to 
			  read them cover to cover to find the climbs you want as they never index routes via height, 
			  only grade. So you end up spending sometimes £50 on a book for an area you may visit once or 
			  twice to do a handful of climbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Multi-pitch.com hopes to solve this. Nothing gets added to the site without an image of the 
			  crag and the exact geo-location of the crag. Everything is filterable by length and grade 
			  and many other factors so you can <strong>find the exact adventure you want.</strong>

			<h3>What's coming next on the website?</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li><strong>More routes</strong> is a given, but obviously maintaining quality is key. Every route 
							  requires quite a lot of research. </li>
					<li><strong>More filter options</strong> are also on their way. You will be able to exclude sea stacks or routes that tend to have lots of loose rock etc. </li>
					<li><strong>Saving filter preferences</strong> so you can pick up where you left off. </li>
					<li><strong>Adding Climbs to a Wishlist</strong> so you can keep track of your own climbing goals. </li>
					<li><strong>More Super detailed guides</strong> like our guide to wreakers slab on Cornakey Cliff with its super zoom topo.</li>

			<h3>Rock Climbing is Dangerous</h3>
            <p>
				A big aspect of climbing, especially trad climbing, is about managing 
			    risk. This website contains my thoughts &amp; experiences as a climbing enthusiast, not a 
				professional. Do not treat this site as instruction. As <a href="https://www.thebmc.co.uk/risk-and-safety" target="blank">
				the BMC states</a> rock climbing is activities with a danger 
				of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept 
				these risks and be responsible for their own actions.
