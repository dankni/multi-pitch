			  To rock climb is to test your body for strength, stamina and co-ordination. 
			  To place your own protection while climbing will also test your nerve, make 
			  your brain analyse and solve complex problems all the while overcoming fear. 
			  Multi-pitch rock climbing provides a sense of achievement that is hard to match. 
			  Climbing a mountain is literally the kind of achievement people refer to in analogy to 
			  describe everyday success against adversity. 
              </p>
			  <p>
			  The un-bolted mountain is one of the last vestiges of the world not tamed by 
			  mankind. The mountain is sovereign and the climber is just a temporary trespasser. 
			  The mountain doesn’t care who ascends or bails. A climber on a multi-pitch route 
			  can find themselves exhausted, frustrated and stuck. The uniqueness of the situation 
			  is subtle, but put simply, a climber can find themselves in a situation with no 
			  easy way out. The very nature of many trad multi-pitch climbs, means they can be 
			  just as hard to attempt to escape as they are to continue climbing and ascend. The 
			  challenge and commitment required can be all encompassing on both mind and body; 
			  but the feeling of success is all the greater for being hard earned.
            </p>
			<p>
			  My experiance is however, not unique. Al Alvarez shares a similar view.

			    To put yourself into a situation where a mistake cannot necessarily be 
			    recouped, where the life you lose may be your own, clears the head wonderfully. 
			    It puts domestic problems back into proportion and adds an element of seriousness 
			    to your drab, routine life. Perhaps this is one reason why climbing has become 
			    increasingly hard as society has become increasingly, disproportionately, coddling.

              This site has been spun from a mixture of passion, concern and frustration.
			</p>
			<p>
            <p>
			  <strong>Passion</strong>
            </p>
			<p>
			  A passion for rock climbing clearly underpins this site. The site also comes from 
			  a passion to create and build something unique that can be used and shared with 
			  friends to plan great trips and create memories that will last a lifetime. A way 
			  to give something small back to a diverse and growing community of people who 
			  share a passion for adventure and life.
			</p>
			<p>
			  <strong>Concern</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			  Bouldering and sport climbing are wonderful disciplines and should hopefully 
			  form an important part of any climber’s repertoire. With the growth of climbing
			  walls and the upcoming inclusion of rock climbing in the Tokyo Olympics, these 
			  disciplines are well represented. Trad climbing on the other hand feels less 
			  accessible. This site hopefully goes some small way to helping promote trad 
			  climbing and the unique experience it can create. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Bolting a route isn’t a bad thing, in-fact it’s sometimes vital to keep climbs 
			  safe. In addition, sport climbing lets people push themselves and their limits 
			  with reduced risk. However, if a traditional ethic isn’t also promoted, eventually 
			  more mountains will be bolted which reduces the opportunity to experience 
			  traditional climbing. This seems especially true in climbing areas of Eastern 
			  Europe and North Africa. It would be a shame if what is arguably one of the 
			  purest forms of safe climbing were to dwindle. Hopefully this site help people 
			  understand the joy and uniqueness of trad climbing and can therefore help 
			  climbers make more informed bolting decisions. 
			</p>
			<p>
            <p>
			  <strong>Frustration</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			  It’s difficult and expensive to plan great climbing trips. If you don’t have a local 
			  crag then any climbing trip is an excursion. About 20million people live in or around 
			  London and the South East UK. It can be quicker and sadly cheaper to fly to Spain than 
			  get a train to somewhere in the UK like the Lakes, Cornwall, Wales or Scotland.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Although there are many useful websites out there like UKC or the mountain project,  
			  without exception they focus on volume. This can mean the quality of the information 
			  suffers. Many rotes don't have any information and most don't have any pictures, let 
			  alone good imagery or topography. This means buying lots of guidebooks becomes 
			  essential. These have the information needed but are also full of information you 
			  don't need. E9 anyone? To asses options and plan properly can require dozens of books. 
			  Further frustration comes because they never index routes via height, only grade. 
			  The result is spending lots of money and reading thousands of pages to find a handful 
			  of climbs that match what you want. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Multi-pitch.com hopes to solve this. Nothing gets added to the site without an image 
			  of the crag and the exact geo-location of the crag. Everything is filterable by length 
			  and grade and many other factors so <em>you can find the exact adventure you want.</em>

			<h3>What's coming next on the website?</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li><strong>More routes</strong> is a given, but obviously maintaining quality is key. Every route 
							  requires quite a lot of research. </li>
					<li><strong>More filter options</strong> are also on their way. You will be able to exclude sea stacks or routes that tend to have lots of loose rock etc. </li>
					<li><strong>Saving filter preferences</strong> so you can pick up where you left off. </li>
					<li><strong>Adding Climbs to a Wishlist</strong> so you can keep track of your own climbing goals. </li>
					<li><strong>More Super detailed guides</strong> like our guide to wreakers slab on Cornakey Cliff with its super zoom topo.</li>
