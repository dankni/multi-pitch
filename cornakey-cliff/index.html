				<small>
				A big aspect of climbing, especially trad climbing, is about managing 
			    risk. The below are my thoughts &amp; experiences as a climbing enthusiast, not a 
				professional. Do not treat this site instruction. Climbing Wreakers Slab on Cornakey Cliff 
				is especially risky in places. As <a href="https://www.thebmc.co.uk/risk-and-safety" target="blank">
				the BMC states</a> rock climbing is activities with a danger 
				of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept 
				these risks and be responsible for their own actions.

            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
				It's fair to say everyone has a slightly different experience on wreakers slab, partly because the 
				cliff is loose and the holds likely change regularly, even between the leader and the second! This 
				makes helmets an absolute must. Due to its scale it's likely a lot of people also take slightly different 
				lines, especially at the bottom and top pitches where the route is less clear. I think it justifies the 
				grade of VS 4b. With the low technical grade it's an easy route to underestimate. A lot of the protection 
				early on is marginal and some placements could actually make the climb more dangerous. For instance a 
				cam behind a large loose block could put the seconds life in danger. More info on this in the gear section 
				below. In short, it's not an ideal choice for those new to traditional multi-pitch climbing, but offers 
				stunning views and is a wonderful lengthy adventure if you have the experience lead it.

            <h3>THE ROUTE</h3>
            <p>
				Use the super zoom of the topography to get to grips with the route. Below is my write up of the climb.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Pitch 1</strong> 
				<span class="badge badge-pill green">4a</span> 
				<span class="badge badge-pill orange">35m</span> <br/ >
				My experience here is reasonably worthless except to say if you leave 
				the guidebook at the top of the cliff (because who wants to climb with a guide book in their bag), 
				then the chances are you won’t actually know exactly which way to go and may attack the first belay 
				head on. This takes you over loose ground with little or no gear and possibly makes the route a 
				harder grade. Instead I’d recommend you use the super zoom image to the right to plan a better 
				approach. Don’t start too far right, climb up a few of meters to where the cliff eases off then traverse all the 
				way left and head up to the belay. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are 2 pegs that you can use to form part of your belay. I’d highly recommend a 3 or 4 point anchor 
				in addition to them. I placed my gear below the pegs giving a reasonably comfy ledge to belay from. 
				Jump to the gear section for more advice here, but needless to say your nut tool comes in handy when 
				you lead that pitch!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Pitch 2</strong>
				<span class="badge badge-pill green">4b</span> 
				<span class="badge badge-pill orange">45m</span> <br/ > Head up and around the overhanging block just above the belay. Whilst this 
				is probably the steepest part of the climb it’s not fully vertical making gear placements easier than
				they look. Be careful not to throw too many handholds at the belay below and follow the reasonably 
				obvious crack up to a big grassy ledge with a pillar of rock on it.  There are lots of options for 
				a multi-point belay here. You can use the front of the pillar, side or even the nearby crack.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Pitch 3</strong>
				<span class="badge badge-pill green">4a</span> 
				<span class="badge badge-pill orange">50m</span> <br/ >	This is where the rock climbing becomes utterly enjoyable. For the most part the rock is 
				solid and there are plenty of placements for gear in the first 20m of this pitch at least. The odd 
				section might be run-out but there is so much bomber gear below it didn’t bother me. I went up the 
				left hand ridge with its stunning if a little intense views. The guide book says the pitch is 45m, 
				but I went the full 50 to get over the top and right a little. You can set up a good belay on the 
				other side of the top ridge. I’d recommend also belaying your partner off the top 10m walk just in 
				case. Whilst it would be a stretch to call it a 4th pitch, we still placed 2 pieces of gear, would 
				be a shame to slip off the back of the cliff after such a beautiful climb.

            <h3>THE APPROCH</h3>
            <p>
				The BMC regional access database has the wrong coordinates for parking and the 
				guide book (cite) underestimates the approach time considerably! Allow an hour 
				for the approach and be happy if you get to the crag in less.
			<p>
			<p>
				Park in Morwenstow tea room car park lat/lon: 50.908732, -4.553767. Go into the morwenstow graveyard and pass 
				out the bottom (north east) down a path past some private housing into a small 
				wooded area. Go over the tiny stream and turn left out of the woods. Cross two fields
				and turn right at the cliff edge. Follow the coastal path until you see Cornakey 
				Cliff. When above it, pass behind it to a sketchy and thorny scramble down the 
				slope. Reach the loose rib and work your way down to the makeshift hut. Pass that 
				to the (hopefully) in-situ rope. Descend to sea level when the tide is out and 
				make your way around to the base of the climb. This may require some rock hopping 
				or down climbing. Don't forget to enjoy the descent, it's part of the experience.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				You can check the <a href="http://www.tidetimes.org.uk/bude-tide-times">tide times for Bude here</a>. 
				Bude further south but should be a good indicator. Note the tides can be huge so don't get caught out!

            <h3>THE ROCK</h3>
            <p>
				There is a lot going on at Cornakey Cliff geologically. It's on the so called 
				Culm Coast, therefore the cliff is made up of the rock supergroup culm.  
				For the most part it's a sedimentary formation from the Carboniferous period 
				comprising of hard sandstone and soft shale. This was then flipped from flat to 
				vertical some time after formation. Parts of the rock also appear to have undergone 
				metamorphic transformation which has turned the softer shale into slate, either 
				in part or completely. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The end result is wonderfully varied climbing. Parts of the first pitch are thin 
				and crimpy slate like sheets, giving good if slightly delicate hand and foot placements. 
				The larger layers formed in the sedimentary process offer cracks and jugs throughout 
				and as the climb rises it give way to more sandstone which offers ledges, jugs, 
				cracks and the occasional slopping hold. However you get to choose what you want 
				to use for much of the route, and you are not really forced to adopt any particular 
				style of rock climbing.
