                <h3>British Adjectival System</h3>
                <p>
                    The British Adjectival System is usually seen as two different grades. An adjectival 
                    grade, for example <abbr title="Very Severe">VS</abbr>, and a technical grade for 
                    example 4b. The adjectival grade is an all-encompassing view of the difficulty of 
                    the climb. This looks at how hard the moves are, how good the protection is, how 
                    strenuous the overall route is, how loose the rock is etc. The technical grade 
                    simply looks at the hardest move on the route and grades it using the British system, 
                    which is, unfortunately different to the French sport system used in almost all British 
                    climbing walls, making it easy to get confused! For example an English 6a is much, 
                    much harder than a French sport 6a, often shown as f6a. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong>: <a href="/climbs/wreakers-slab-on-cornakey-cliff/">Wreakers slab on Cornakey 
                    Cliff</a> is graded VS 4b. This is an unusually high adjectival grade for such a low 
                    technical grade. On the route the climber will notice a few key factors which lead to the 
                    VS grade. Firstly, it has a lot of loose rock. In addition, protection is not 
                    straightforward or easy to find early on. It’s also tidal, meaning escape down could 
                    be closed for a long time if ascent is not possible. The route has a lot of exposure.
                    Finally, it’s over 100m long, meaning some endurance is required.  
                    In contrast, <a href="/climbs/doorpost-on-bosigran/">Doorpost at Bosigran</a>, Cornwall, 
                    is also 4b in technical grade, but has an overall adjectival grade of Hard Severe 
                    which is a grade Lower. Doorpost probably has a harder crux on pitch 2, but protection 
                    is good throughout the route and the rock is solid, so overall it has a lower adjectival 
                    grade.

                <h3>UIAA Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    The International Union of Alpine Associations is grading system reasonably common 
                    in mainland Europe. It’s represented by Roman numerals from I through to VII and is 
                    now open ended to X (ten) and beyond. One key advantage of this system is its 
                    <a href="https://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/uiaa-grades-for-rock-climbing/" target="blank">clear 
                    descriptions</a> from grades I to VII. Essentially the system grades the hardest 
                    move in the route. However, the system takes no real account of either protection 
                    available or other factors that may impact a climber’s performance like exposure or 
                    altitude. As such the Alpine system or Scale of Global Assessment and French “sport" 
                    systems are both offshoots/additions of the UIAA scale, which itself is developed from 
                    the Welzenbach Scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong>: The climb <a href="/climbs/esparraguera-on-roca-gris/">Esparraguera 
                    on Roca Gris</a> is graded V+. This speaks to the hardest move, which is pulling up on a jug
                     on the 3rd pitch. However the climb is also graded f5c, which is a slightly high 
                     conversion. The reason being the French sport system looks at the difficulty of 
                     each pitch (or length of rope) not just the hardest move, but also not the whole 
                     route like the alpine system. The UIAA scale and sport grade say nothing about 
                     the complexity of the route in terms of exposure, loose rock, route finding and 
                     run-out sections. Being comfortable climbing a UIAA V+ or f5c for 30m would be 
                     poor training for this beautifully complex route.

                <h3>French Sport Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    French numerical grades were originally an offshoot of the UIAA system. In theory
                    they aim to grade the difficulty of a pitch. However whole routes are given 
                    the grade of the hardest pitch. The scale currently runs from 1 to 9c. Grades 
                    from 3 onwards can be sub divided into a, b & c for example 5c is harder than 5b. 
                    Grades from 6a onwards can additionally have a plus (and occasionally a minus) 
                    added where a 6a+ is harder than a 6a but easier than a 6b. This is the most 
                    common system used for grading sport routes and is used in most lead climbing 
                    gyms in Europe. The major downside to the system is that it doesn’t take into 
                    account protection or rock quality, or even the overall difficulty of multi-pitch 
                    rock climbs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong>: <a href="/climbs/visite-obligatoire-on-aiguille-dibona/">Visite
                    Obligatoire on the mountain Aiguille Dibona</a> is graded 6a+. It has some tough pitches,
                    but being able to climb 6a+ in the gym is not going to be enough to get you up all 
                    350m of this route. In fact climbers who can often manage 6c or 7a have failed to 
                    ascend this route. Therefore the alpine adjectival grade of <em>trés difficile</em> 
                    is much more representitive. I.e. it’s a solid E1 in British grades.

                <h3>Yosemite Decimal System</h3>
                <p>
                    The Yosemite Decimal System has a lot of complexity to it, most of which isn’t used day 
                    to day. Firstly, the initial number before the decimal indicates the type of terrain 
                    where 4 is roped scrambling and 5 is climbing. 1 would presumably be walking to the 
                    shop. Aid climbs originally started with a 6 but most people don’t use that anymore. 
                    All multi-pitch free climbing will start with a five. 5.4 is easer than 5.9. Once the 
                    scale hits 5.10 then letters a, b, c and d can be added. Ie 5.10a. The system grades 
                    the hardest move, although on modern routes the grades factor in how sustained they are 
                    as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong> The climb <a href="/climbs/joy-on-mount-indefatigable/">Joy on 
                    Mount Indefatigable</a> is graded around 5.7. The grade band between 5.5 and 5.9 is pretty 
                    tight, in addition, because the Yosemite Decimal system looks at the hardest move, you 
                    can easily add 2 grades to the climb but taking a tiny variation on one pitch. The 
                    route joy is between 5.6 and 5.8 on the YDS scale.

                <h3>Norwegian Grades</h3>
                <p>
                    The Norwegian Grading system started out as the UIAA system but as climbing 
                    progressed up to and then past the original ceiling of the sixth grade, 
                    the Norwegian system diverged. It switched to using Arabic numbers eg. 6 
                    rather than Roman Numerals eg VI. The main difference is, grades tend to be 
                    slightly harder at around the fifth grade and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong>: The <a href="/climbs/sydpillaren-on-stetind/">South Pillar 
                    climb on Stetind </a> is graded around 6-. This makes the route somewhere between 
                    HVS and E1. Given the length and seriousness of the route E1 is the appropriate 
                    conversion to British grades, but it is a full VI on the UIAA scale.

                <h3>Alpine Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    The Scale of Global Assessment, usually called the Alpine Scale, gives an overall
                    adjectival grade to climbing routes much like the British system. This fills 
                    the gap in the UIAA and sport grading systems where the grade says little about 
                    the seriousness of the route. The system uses French terms and runs from F for 
                    facile (easy in English) to ED for extrêmement difficile (extremely difficult) 
                    ED is open ended with numbers to ED4.
                <p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example</strong>: <a href="/climbs/visite-obligatoire-on-aiguille-dibona/">Visite
                    Obligatoire on the mountain Aiguille Dibona</a> is graded TD. TD is described as Very hard,
                    routes at this grades are serious undertakings with high level of objective danger... 
                    Rock climbing at UIAA grade V and VI with possible aid, very long sections of hard 
                    climbing. The alpine adjectival grade of <em>trés difficile</em> is a solid E1 in 
                    British grades.
