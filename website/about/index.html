            <p>
			  To rock climb is to test your body for strength, stamina and co-ordination.
			  To place your own protection while climbing will also test your nerve, make 
			  your brain analyse and solve complex problems all the while overcoming fear. 
			  Multi-pitch rock climbing provides a sense of achievement that is hard to match. 
			  Climbing a mountain is literally the kind of achievement people refer to in analogy to 
			  describe everyday success against adversity. 
              </p>
			  <p>
			  The un-bolted mountain is one of the last vestiges of the world not tamed by 
			  mankind. The mountain is sovereign and the climber is just a temporary trespasser. 
			  The mountain doesn’t care who ascends or bails. A climber on a multi-pitch route 
			  can find themselves exhausted, frustrated and stuck. The uniqueness of the situation 
			  is subtle, but put simply, a climber can find themselves in a situation with no 
			  easy way out. The very nature of many trad multi-pitch climbs, means they can be 
			  just as hard to attempt to escape as they are to continue climbing and ascend. The 
			  challenge and commitment required can be all encompassing on both mind and body; 
			  but the feeling of success is all the greater for being hard earned.
            </p>
			<p>
			  My experience is however, not unique. Al Alvarez shares a similar view.

			    To put yourself into a situation where a mistake cannot necessarily be 
			    recouped, where the life you lose may be your own, clears the head wonderfully. 
			    It puts domestic problems back into proportion and adds an element of seriousness 
			    to your drab, routine life. Perhaps this is one reason why climbing has become 
			    increasingly hard as society has become increasingly, disproportionately, coddling.

              This site has been spun from a mixture of passion, concern and frustration.
			</p>
			<h4>Passion & Inspiration</h4>
			<p>
			  A passion for rock climbing clearly underpins this site. The site also comes from a 
			  desire to create and build something unique that can be used and shared with friends 
			  to plan great trips and create memories that will last a lifetime. The site has been 
			  designed and structured to inspire climbers. Hopefully it will give fuel to a diverse
			  and growing community of people who share a passion for adventure and life.
			</p>

				The more important lesson is to value the struggle, in and of itself. 
				The obstacle isn't in the way it IS the way. As climbers this should be intuitive 
				because, you can usually always walk round! We purposefully seek out the hardest 
				pieces of rock to get to the top of because we see the value in the obstacle itself 
				not because there is no other way round it.
				<cite>- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1JAOxSHGB6/" target="blank">Hazel Findlay</a></cite>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>Promote the Traditional Ethic</h4>
			<p>
			  Bouldering and sport climbing are wonderful disciplines and should hopefully form an 
			  important part of any climber’s repertoire. With the growth of climbing walls and the 
			  upcoming inclusion of rock climbing in the Tokyo Olympics, these disciplines are well 
			  represented. Trad climbing on the other hand feels less accessible 
			  (<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=GB&q=sport%20climbing,trad%20climbing,bouldering" target="blank">see trends here</a>). 
			  This site hopefully goes some small way to helping promote trad climbing and the 
			  unique experience it can create. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Bolting a route isn’t a bad thing, in-fact it’s sometimes vital to keep climbs safe. 
			  In addition, sport climbing lets people push themselves and their limits with reduced 
			  risk. However, if a traditional ethic isn’t also promoted, eventually more mountains 
			  will be bolted which reduces the opportunity to experience traditional climbing. 
			  This seems especially true in climbing areas of mainland Europe. It would be a shame 
			  if what is arguably one of the purest forms of safe climbing were to dwindle. Hopefully 
			  this site will help people understand the joy and uniqueness of trad climbing and can 
			  therefore help climbers make more informed bolting decisions. Great article from 
			  <a href="https://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/blog/view/hand-bolting" target="blank">Andy Kirkpatrick
			  on Bolting</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Ken Wilson was a massive advocate of traditional rock climbing. The below quote from him sums up
			  some of the important differances in both skill and experiance the climber gains from trad climbing.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				On real cliffs with real dangers, one has to rapidly master the skill and 
				judgment required to avoid accidents. One must find the route, assess the problems, 
				make the moves while also placing reliable protection. In addition, the powerful 
				aura and complexity of cliffs has to be faced, together with descent problems, 
				benightment and bad weather.
				<cite> - Ken Wilson</cite>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				John Ewbank's keynote at the Escalade Festival in 1993 touched on a key aspect of the magic 
				involved in traditional climbing, especially true of multi-pitch routes that sit in quiet 
				isolation in the mountains.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				It may serve us well to remember though, that just as aid climbing, as an end in itself, 
				became more or less passe – or at least not the ultimate skill to aspire to – the times 
				will change again and today’s hardest and most highly-prized bolted sport routes may 
				well come to be viewed as the quaint relics of a passing phase that climbing had to 
				go through. Climbs achieve their own market value within the psyche of each new 
				generation. Personally I believe that the wheel will turn a full 360 degrees and 
				that the most valued climbs of the future will once more be routes where all that 
				exists is the illusion of the absence of previous human passage – as opposed to 
				those climbs which bear the rusting or stainless steel evidence of it.
				<cite> - John Ewbank</cite>

			<h4>A Useful Tool to Find Adventure</h4>
			<p>
			  It’s difficult and expensive to plan great climbing trips. It can be quicker and sadly 
			  cheaper to fly from the UK to Spain, than get a train to somewhere in the UK like 
			  the Lakes, Cornwall, Wales or Scotland.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Although there are many useful websites out there like UKC or the mountain project, 
			  they tend to focus on volume. This can mean the quality of the information suffers. 
			  Many routes don't have any information and most don't have any pictures, let alone good 
			  imagery or topography. This means buying lots of guidebooks becomes essential. These 
			  have the information needed but are also full of information you don't need. E9 anyone? 
			  To assess options and plan properly can require dozens of books. Further frustration 
			  comes because they never index routes via height, only grade. The result is spending 
			  lots of money and reading thousands of pages to find a handful of climbs that match 
			  what you want.  
			</p>
			<p>
			  Multi-pitch.com hopes to solve this. Nothing gets added to the site without an image 
			  of the crag and the exact geo-location of the crag. Everything is filterable by length 
			  and grade and many other factors so <em>you can find the exact adventure you want.</em>

				This website is being developed by Dan and Michel. As you might have guessed by the spread of 
				routes, we <del>both live in London England</del> live in the UK with Dan moving to 
				the foot of the <a href="/map/?loc=54.160649,-5.961364">Mourne mountains</a> in 2020. 
				This site was born from our ever growing <em>must climb</em> list. With full time jobs,
				when we do get to go climbing outdoors we want 
				to get the most out of it and not spend hours walking around looking for the cliff (Like when 
				we climbed <a href="/climbs/wreakers-slab-on-cornakey-cliff/">Wreakers slab on Cornakey cliff
				</a>). So the site is all about helping us and hopefully others, choose and then enjoy the 
				best multi-pitch rock climbs. We try and include lots of variety in grade as well 
				as type of climbing, length and rocktype. We would love to hear any feedback, questions or 
				requests you have.
