                        A blog to champion the virtues of the traditional climbing ethic. Written by a pair of un-remarkable
                        climbers who enjoy long multi-pitch climbs typically no harder than E1. The blog covers views on gear, techniques,
                        training and destinations.

                    The blog will cover some of how we got into trad multi-pitch climbing, the techniques we have
                    learned and which we lean on the most. We will talk about the gear we choose as well as training methods we
                    find helpful. The blog will be meandering, but it will also be scientific and very detailed in places.
