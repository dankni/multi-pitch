With around 120m of cliff to scale, it makes for a great day out.

Cross two fields and turn right at the cliff edge. Follow the coastal path until you see Cornakey Cliff. When above it, pass behind it to a sketchy and thorny scramble down the slope. Reach the loose rib and work your way down to the makeshift hut. Pass that to the (hopefully) in-situ rope. Descend to sea level when the tide is out and make your way around to the base of the climb. This may require some rock hopping or down climbing. Don't forget to enjoy the descent, it's part of the experience.","pitchInfo":"It's fair to say everyone has a slightly different experience on wreckers slab, partly because the cliff is loose and the holds likely change regularly, even between the leader and the second! This makes helmets an absolute must. Due to its scale it's likely a lot of people also take slightly different lines, especially at the bottom and top pitches where the route is less clear. I think it justifies the grade of VS 4b. With the low technical grade it's an easy route to underestimate. A lot of the protection early on is marginal and some placements could actually make the climb more dangerous. For instance, a cam behind a large loose block could put the seconds life in danger. In short, it's not an ideal choice for those new to traditional multi-pitch climbing, but it offers stunning views and is a wonderful lengthy adventure if you have the experience lead it.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">40m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade\"\">4a</span></strong><br />\r\nMy experience here is reasonably worthless except to say if you leave the guidebook at the top of the cliff (because who wants to climb with a guide book in their bag), then the chances are you won’t actually know exactly which way to go and may attack the first belay head on. This takes you over loose ground with little or no gear and possibly makes the route a harder grade. Instead I’d recommend you don’t start too far right, climb up a few of meters to where the cliff eases off then traverse all the way left to the arete and head up to the belay.\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 2 pegs that you can use to form part of your belay. I’d highly recommend a 3 or 4 point anchor in addition to them. I placed my gear below the pegs giving a reasonably comfy ledge to belay from.

Be careful not to throw too many handholds at the belay below and follow the reasonably obvious crack up to a big grassy ledge with a pillar of rock on it.  There are lots of options to build a traditional anchor here.

For the most part the rock is solid and there are plenty of placements for gear, the left ridge is recommended with its stunning if a little intense views. Guidebooks suggest the pitch is 45m, but a the full 50m will take you over the top and right a little. A good belay can be built on the other side of the top ridge. Consider belaying your partner off the top 10m walk.

Whilst described as a clean trad route in many guidebooks, Esparraguera has a good amount bolts (17) and pitons (2) in sections in the middle pitches. Most of the harder moves are protected by old bolts. You will need a full trad rack of nuts and cams. Tri cams are particularly helpful for the pockets. The last pitch has no fixed protection. The route is given f5c in some guides or UIAA V+ in others, it is hard to convert to British grades but given the protection is good at the harder sections, the British grade of VS 5a (maybe HVS 5b) seems best.

Because it’s an absolute classic it can be popular, even out of season. The climb is interesting and sustained, with a mixture of delicate slab work and a few big moves on a steep wall on the 3rd pitch. The views are incredible looking out over the valley and the exposure is immense in places.  Especially where the climb moves between the spires, up the middle of the 4th pitch and the travers across a ledge on the 5th pitch. The route could be climbed clean without use of the bolts if you have the confidence, time, patience and stamina to find protection on the slab sections which can be quite blank. It’s quicker and likely more enjoyable if you climb the route mixed, using the in-situ bolts with additional gear to protect the run out sections on the 1st, 4th and 5th pitches and protection for the <em>entire</em> 6th pitch. A set of cams, nuts and tri-cams should cover you. Larger pieces could be helpful on the last pitch. 50m ropes are enough to get to the top, but 60m ropes are needed for the decent to save down climbing the last abseil or using a tree / bush for the last part. The rock can be loose, especially on pitch 1. Loose rocks also tend to gather on the ledges, so make sure you wear helmet and try to avoid dislodging rock onto the path below which can be popular with hikers, who won’t have helmets! All the belay points have 3 expansion bolts which can be used for the anchors, except the top of the route where you will need to sling a bush or two and make sure you are not belaying more weight up than can be comfortably held.

Technically it’s 3 climbs: Avalanche then Red Wall then Longlands Continuation. These routes  flow into each other with a number of variants. For example you could swap out Avalanche and Red Wall for The Sword & Route 2. This would up the grade to Very Severe thanks to the first pitch of The Sword. With everything that’s going on on Y Lliwedd, the route finding can be a challenge but most sections up the Eastern Buttress of the crag are not too high in grade. Mount Y Lliwedd (colourless peak in English) was where British mountaineers trained before making some of the first attempts to summit Everest.","approach":"<strong>Parking</strong>: If you arrive very early (due to limited spaced) and don’t mind the parking fees, Parking in Pen Y Pass is easiest.

Allow plenty of time for route finding on the 12 pitches. Most of the climbing is technically straightforward with an reasonably exposed 4a pitch on the Red Wall section that’s very memorable and a crux 4b pitch right at the end which is a delicate slab with good but smaller spaced holds. 2 pitches are a short walk along a ledge so some time can be saved there. Allowing 12 hours for a round trip from Pen Y Pass would be sensible. It can be done much quicker, especially if you know the route, however it could also take much longer if you get lost so bringing a decent headtorch is a good idea. The route is North facing, so will be in the shade most of the day, this means it can take a couple of good days to dry out. Climbing it damp will be much harder and less enjoyable. The route has been given the grade Hard Very Difficult or HVD in older guides and Severe in the newer rockFax. Protection is mostly good, but being able to confidently and easily climb severe 4b is essential as there are not many easy escape options. J. Longland added his continuation to the Redwall in 1929. Where grades are shown as 3c I’m simply marking that it’s rock climbing of low technical difficulty by modern standards.

You can either create a new belay here or link this into the next pitch as one. If you are linking these up then make sure you use a long runner and ideally a carabineer with a wheel like the DMM Revolver. If in doubt don’t run them together or the rope drag will take the fun out of the climb and you risk a ground / ledge fall.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 10 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br />\r\nIf you end up climbing an awkward but enjoyable chimney, chances are you left the ledge in the wrong place and may find the route slightly more difficult. The route is supposed to climb the left arete off of the right side of the Green Gallery, heading up and leftwards to some ledges and a slab.

From here decend the gully rightwards to a large chockstone, and make a 30m abseil (or a 10m and 20m abseil if using a single rope) move right and make one final 40m abseil (again 15m and 25m if using single ropes).

Originally climbed in 1966 by Rusty Baillie, Chris Bonington and Tom Patey, this iconic multi-pitch has been the centre of some of the most focused media attention around climbing in the late 1990’s. The route climbs the east landward face, of this northern Scottish sandstone stack. It’s technically not a sea stack (because it’s attached to the mainland), but is usually referred to as such. The route requires a mix of technical climbing, including a short down climb, a traverse, as well as crack climbing and bridging skills. The route is made harder by nesting Fulmars who don’t like climbers around their nests. Descent from the top requires abseiling back down the route. The Original Route is listed in Ken Wilsons Hard Rock book, sitting alongside other UK classics in the <abbr title=\"Very Severe\">HVS</abbr> to <abbr title=\"Extremely Severe\">E1</abbr> range. The route has seen some incredible accents over the years, including being climbed by Red Szell as the first blind man to climb up The Old Man of Hoy. In more recent years Jesse Dufton, also blind, went one step further and climbed it on lead. Chris Bonington also made recent repeat of this stack while in his 80’s, over 50 years after his first accent, he climbed the stack with Leo Holding. The climb was originally graded HVS, but most recent guidebooks list it as E1. Although some pitches are straightforward, it would be easy to underestimate the complexity of getting up and back down safely. The exposure is incredible.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: Head up the hill behind Rackwick Hostel until reaching the cottage at the top from which a well-constructed path will lead to the viewing promontory across from the Old Man of Hoy. Head North 120m from here and take the small well-worn path down to the rubble scramble to the stack at the base. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: There are two options for descent. The first is to abseil each pitch. Typically, there will be slings left behind to rap from at each anchor point. The climber should come prepared to replace them if they are not in a suitable condition. There is also sometimes a rope in situ to help with the pitch two traverse. If the party is not using 60m ropes, and there is not a rope in situ on pitch two, then climbers should be prepared to leave a spare rope behind on ascent, in order to facilitate the descent here. Alternatively, if the party is using a pair of 60m ropes, these can be used to rappel to the end of pitch 3. Then a short rappel to the end of pitch two. Then a longer rappel, free hanging, should take the climbers to the base of the stack. It should go without saying, but climbers should have a pair of prusik cords during the abseil. One to back up the abseil, the other in case the climber needs to ascend the rope for some reason.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":null,"face":"E","abseil":1,"traverse":1,"boat":null,"tidal":1,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-12-15T12:00:00.000Z","updateTimestamp":1576368000},{"cliff":"Ksar Rock","status":"publish","id":35,"country":"Morocco","county":"Souss-Massa","routeName":"East Buttress","length":120,"pitches":6,"dataGrade":4,"tradGrade":"HS","techGrade":"4b","gradeSys":"BAS","originalGrade":"HS 4b","flag":"morocco","geoLocation":"29.81270,-9.06676","approachTime":10,"approachDifficulty":1,"rock":"Quartzite","intro":"Ksar rock offers great multi-pitch rock climbing up to around 150 meters with plenty of climbs in grades from Severe to E1.

Tafraout granite was formed from slow cooling lava and as a result, it has a very coarse crystalline structure. The rock is also surprisingly brittle in places where it looks solid. This makes an interesting change from the nearby quartzite rock, which looks loose but is generally very solid. Although not a pure trad line thanks to a bolted start and bolted finish, the crack system in the middle two pitches offers exceptional traditional climbing. This popular route is a great option if there is bad weather on the Jebel el Kest mountains. As a south facing route, it’s possible to literally watch the granite dry over a 30miniute period after heavy rain. The start is disproportionately harder than the rest of the route.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: The approach to the High Sierra Dome is a straightforward walk from the &quot;car park&quot;. Drive into and through the village of Aguerd Oudad, under Napoleon’s Hat. Follow a dirt path out of the back of the village until you see the High Sierra Dome on the right. The climb can be approached directly with a scramble on the boulders to gain the base of the climb. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: Upon reaching the summit boulder, abseil back to the main plateau. Whilst it’s possible to lower off of the malion, the climber’s rope will undoubtably have picked up a lot of fine granite dust and sand along the route, meaning that running the weighted rope though the malion when lowering off, will wear through the metal (and damage your rope) faster. This will mean both need replacing more frequently. When abseiling, the rope sits statically on the malion reducing wear. From the plateau, walk east and behind the summit boulder. i.e. from the end of the abseil, turn to face the 3rd pitch anchor and walk forwards and left around the summit boulder. From here the climber walks past an incredible boulder shaped like the letter n. The climber carries onto the back of the plateau and walks of to the left (West) side to scramble down and back around.","pitchInfo":"The route is described as esoteric in some guides for good reason. The first few moves of the climb require friction stepping, on steep rock with very few and very small handholds. It can seem outrageously hard for the technical grade of 5a. These first moves are unlikely to get easier as the route weathers years of climber’s feet, that said the sticky rubber of climbing shoes adheres to the granite in a way that defies sense. The first pitch can be avoided by approaching from further left or aided using the two starting bolts. After this the climb then offers a wonderful undercut pitch that is reminiscent of <a href=\"/climbs/doorpost-on-bosigran/\">Doorpost’s first pitch at Bosigran</a>, only bigger and longer. The third pitch offers some initial friction climbing that leads to an incredible and rather unique waist height flake.

Walk along this ramp to the first bolt. Make the aforementioned hard moves, relying on small holds for both hands and feet. After a couple of tricky moves onto the block the second bolt can be clipped. From here the route moves up and right to increasingly better holds, with some options for gear placements at the top of the slab. From there move onto the right block then left to the bolted anchor. Alternatively, the climber can move past the bolted anchor onto the ledge and create a quick traditional anchor in the start of the second pitch using the crack system and nearby wedged blocks. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">30m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br />Climb the exceptional sloping crack using mostly undercuts all the way around the corner to a traditional gear belay in the corner before the rising flake of the 3rd pitch. Large cams are particularly helpful for protecting this pitch. \r\n<br/>\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">45m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br />Some delicate friction-based climbing on the low angle slab takes the climber to a bolt. Moving up from here a large flake can be used to comfortably move up the slab. Slings on the granite spikes on the top an edge of the flake can offer some additional protection as the climber moves up. The are also some options for gear higher in the giant flake. As the flake moves right the climber can pull up and slightly left onto the flake where there is a single bolt.

There will be a large boulder with 2 additional smaller boulders on it, one of which has the summit boulder on top. Climb the large wall of the main boulder using the 3 bolts for protection. From here there is easier climbing to the summit boulder and its 2 anchor bolts with an abseil malion. Reaching this is a little runout. From the summit the climbers can abseil back to the plateau and walk off.
