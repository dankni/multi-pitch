What is particularly important about them is fact they travelled with an camera making them some of the first people to capture rock climbing imagery. They set first accents up and down the UK including their first climb on Scafell Crag in 1897. Keswick Brother’s Climb takes a shorter line up the left side of the buttress over easy ground and up the grooved slab. If you have ever wondered why Very Difficult climbs are generally Very Easy, you need to understand the adjectival grading system used in Britain comes from the 1800’s. Climbers in that period didn’t have cams or even nuts. They didn’t have Kernmantle dynamic ropes or dedicated sticky rubber climbing shoes. In fact this climb was graded over 20 years before the carabiner was invented!","approach":"Best approached from Wasdale. Allow an hour to hike uphill to the crag.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":null,"face":null,"abseil":null,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":1,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-04-09T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":17,"Feb":13,"Mar":16,"Apr":13,"May":12,"Jun":12,"Jul":13,"Aug":14,"Sep":14,"Oct":18,"Nov":18,"Dec":17},{"type":"tempH","Jan":7,"Feb":7,"Mar":9,"Apr":12,"May":15,"Jun":18,"Jul":19,"Aug":19,"Sep":17,"Oct":13,"Nov":10,"Dec":8},{"type":"tempL","Jan":2,"Feb":2,"Mar":3,"Apr":4,"May":7,"Jun":9,"Jul":11,"Aug":11,"Sep":9,"Oct":7,"Nov":4,"Dec":2}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/scafell/maps/","alt":"Scafell Crag location","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"54.450659,-3.220281"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/scafell/scafell-route-for-keswick-brothers-climb.jpg","alt":"Topo for keswick Brothers Climb on Scafell Crag","atributionURL":"http://lakelandpilgrimage.blogspot.com/p/the-cathedrals.html","attributionText":"original image","dataFile":null},"referances":[],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9780850280555","title":"Scafell & Wasdale","type":"guidebook","pg":"?","description":"The FRCC Scafell and Wasdale  Climbing guidebook was released in April 2014, 100 years after the first ascent of Central Buttress on Scafell Crag. The Centenary Edition guide is full of inspirational climbs often with great history.
