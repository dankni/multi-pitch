The face has been claimed to be the tallest granite slab in Europe. Whilst untrue, it is never the less one of the tallest slab climbs in England and certainly a must climb classic. It makes for an exceptional climb at an amenable grade. This popular route was climbed, or perhaps more accurately \"walked\", feet only by Jonny Dawes in 2017. Although Lundy (meaning Puffin Island in Norse) has climbing restrictions some of the year, the devils slide and a number of other areas are exempt. The slide doesn't have nesting birds, likely because it's so exposed, bare that in mind when you plan. To get to Lundy a ferry can be taken from Ilfracombe in Devon. Climb up the right-hand side of the slab following the groove. For the last pitch take the obvious traverse left under the headwall. Whilst originally 5 pitches of climbing, it can be done in as few as three with long ropes and careful runner placments. See references below for more info.","approach":"From the top of the cliff descend down the southern gully. One short abseil is required to pass an outcrop. The Blocks at the bottom of the slide can be reached mid-tide and below.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab","face":"W","abseil":1,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-18T12:43:13.906Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":15,"Feb":11,"Mar":13,"Apr":11,"May":10,"Jun":9,"Jul":10,"Aug":11,"Sep":11,"Oct":16,"Nov":16,"Dec":15},{"type":"tempH","Jan":8,"Feb":7,"Mar":8,"Apr":10,"May":12,"Jun":15,"Jul":17,"Aug":17,"Sep":15,"Oct":13,"Nov":11,"Dec":9},{"type":"tempL","Jan":5,"Feb":5,"Mar":6,"Apr":7,"May":9,"Jun":12,"Jul":14,"Aug":14,"Sep":13,"Oct":11,"Nov":8,"Dec":7}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/lundy/maps/","alt":"Map showing the location of the Tormore Sea Stacks","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"51.18856,-4.67622"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/lundy/the-devils-slide-lundy-topo.jpg","alt":"The Devils Slide Route Topography","atributionURL":"https://shadthecat.com/tag/lundy-island/","attributionText":"Original img: Shadthecat","dataFile":5},"referances":[{"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106669941/the-devils-slide","text":"Mountain Project Page"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuTOnNwLUbk","text":"Video: Jonny Dawes cimbs the Devils Slide with only his feet"},{"url":"https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/lundyisland/Timetable/","text":"Travel: Lundy Ferry Timetable & Prices"},{"url":"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lundy/features/facilities-and-access-on-lundy","text":"Info: National Trust Page"},{"url":"https://medium.com/@tommyoswin/lundy-island-circumsummit-3a1577bb7738","text":"Article: Lundy Island CircumSummit"}],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9781873341377","title":"West Country Climbs","type":"guidebook","pg":104,"description":"Whilst this is a great book in general, it's section on Lundy is of little value.

It has good route descriptions and information. The guide covers a great range of climbing areas in the south west of England and covers Lundy, and in particular the Devils Slide climb and its namesake cliff face well. The guidebook is, for the most part, printed in black and white and the photos and diagrams are not up to the standard of more recent guidebooks. However, it does a much better job of route descriptions than most modern guides. Overall not a bad investment, but it certainly feels its age.","imgURL":"img/guidebooks/south-west-climbs-guidebook.jpg","link":"https://amzn.to/2lT6FRL","rrp":19.99}]},"topoData":{"image":"/img/topos/lundy/crag.jpg","flag":"/img/flags/en.png","title":"Lundy > The Devils Slide | HS 4a - 117m","belaySize":24,"route":[[2588,2599],[2540,2436],[2493,2269],[2532,2128],[2513,1839],[2485,1651],[2450,1404],[2475,1376.5],[2345,1199],[2165,762],[2217,698],[2082,431],[2080,359],[1997,361],[1928,367],[1885,267],[1716,186.7]],"pitches":[{"belayPosition":[2587,2599],"labelPosition":[null,null],"grade":"","height":""},{"belayPosition":[2475,1376.5],"labelPosition":[2356.3,1693.5],"grade":"3c","height":"50m"},{"belayPosition":[2217,698],"labelPosition":[2116.3,966.9],"grade":"4a","height":"40m"},{"belayPosition":[1725,189],"labelPosition":[1876.7,418.2],"grade":"4a","height":"30m"}],"decent":[{"anchor":[2515,1376],"labelPosition":[2587,1451.5],"path":[[2520,1394.5],[2540,1504]],"label":"Abseil in"},{"anchor":[null,null],"labelPosition":[2402,763],"path":[[2415,699],[2335,719],[2358,796]],"label":"Scramble or abseil down"}]}}
