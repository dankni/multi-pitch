The route takes one of the easier lines up the main face of Vratsa, however with around 400 meters of limestone the route is challenging in places with a number of pitches grade UIAA VI+ which is at least E1 5c in UK grades. The route also calls for some basic aid in sections. That said its one of the easier lines up the main face of Vratsa. The route has some pitons and bolts in sections but will require a full rack of nuts and cams.","approach":"Approach via P8 (path 8) and leave via P19 (path 19)","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Vertical","face":"S","abseil":null,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-08-26T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":6,"Feb":6,"Mar":6,"Apr":8,"May":8,"Jun":8,"Jul":6,"Aug":5,"Sep":5,"Oct":5,"Nov":7,"Dec":6},{"type":"tempH","Jan":6,"Feb":9,"Mar":14,"Apr":19,"May":24,"Jun":28,"Jul":31,"Aug":30,"Sep":25,"Oct":19,"Nov":12,"Dec":8},{"type":"tempL","Jan":-1,"Feb":1,"Mar":5,"Apr":10,"May":14,"Jun":18,"Jul":20,"Aug":19,"Sep":15,"Oct":10,"Nov":5,"Dec":1}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/vratsa/maps/","alt":"Location of multi-pitch climbing in Vratsa, Bulgaria","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"43.1948,23.53007"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/vratsa/multi-pitch-rock-climbing-on-vratsas-main-face.jpg","alt":"multi-pitch rock climbing on vratsa's main face via Bulgaria 1300","atributionURL":"https://climbing-bulgaria.com/2017/09/13/vratsa-region/","attributionText":"Original: climbing-bulgaria.com","dataFile":5},"referances":[{"url":"https://www.sawthisdidthat.ca/2016/08/day-hike-from-vratsa-bulgaria.html","text":"Hiking in Vratsa, Bulgaria"},{"url":"http://climbing-in-bulgaria.blogspot.com/2011/04/","text":"Blogpost guide to Vratsa"}],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9786199010518","title":"Vratsa Climbing","type":"guidebook","pg":169,"description":"The guidebook is in Bulgarian and in English and coves more than 500 sport and trad climbing routes in Vratsa.
