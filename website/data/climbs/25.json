The route is bolted but requires a small trad rack to ease some of the run out sections. There are many routes on this face, some can be climbed clean. Although it’s a big face with lots of options, expect some crowds. Be wary of rockfall from other parties of climbers and be careful not to dislodge rocks from the pitted limestone route.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: The route is best approached from Stattboden.<br><br>\n<strong>Descent</strong>: Carefully move along the summit to the cross  on the left after the final pitch. From there a path can be followed to walk off the cliff.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab","face":"S","abseil":false,"traverse":false,"boat":false,"tidal":false,"polished":false,"loose":true,"seepage":false,"grassLegdes":false,"lastUpdate":"2021-10-15T01:01:14.339Z","weatherData":{"rainyDays":[10,10,12,14,16,17,17,16,13,10,11,12],"tempH":[-1,-1,2,6,10,12,15,16,13,10,3,-1],"tempL":[-7,-8,-5,-2,1,5,7,8,4,1,-4,-6]},"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/bruggler/maps/","alt":"Briggler is a great climbing location"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/bruggler/bruggler-direct-route-topo.jpg","alt":"The Direct Route up Bruggler","atributionURL":"http://blog.buschnick.net/2013/06/climbing-bruggler-hiking-speer-1950m.html","attributionText":"Original: Soren","dataFile":null},"references":[],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":9783906087405,"title":"Plaisir Selection","type":"guidebook","pg":300,"description":"I want to recommend this guidebook but I just can’t. In some ways it’s brilliant, the hand drawn topos are very artistic, the book has 3 languages and it takes the approach of highlighting the best climbs on the cliff, much like the approach we have taken on multi-pitch.com. Sadly, a lot of the photography is poor to terrible. The “action” shots are from the belay to the leader or second, so give little in the way of inspiration and many of the mountain images are blurry silhouettes.  In addition, the images of the mountains are often just a third of the page. In this pocket-sized book, it means a 400m climb could be reduced to the size of your thumbnail. The final issue is the price which seem to be around £40.","imgURL":"img/guidebooks/plaisir-selection.jpg","link":"https://amzn.to/2QTmPrH","rrp":38}]}}
