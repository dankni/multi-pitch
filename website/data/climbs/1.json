The rock is \nTorridonian sandstone, meaning it was formed before any significant life\n on earth existed. The approach is either some wet rock hopping 100m \nnorth of the stack at the lowest tide or the more classic Tyrolean \ntraverse which may need to be set up by swimming the 8 meter channel if \nthere is not one left in place when you arrive. The route itself, \nOriginal Route, meanders the landward face, following cracks and ledges \nto the top. Larger cams can be helpful. Be wary of nesting sea birds <span><span data-dobid=\"hdw\">whose </span></span>first line of defence is usually to attack by projecting the last meal they ate at nearby unsuspecting climbers.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: Park at the car park near the Stoer Light house (58.237948, -5.400902). From there take the coastal path heading 3Km northwards to the sea stack, going over the hill of Sidhean Mor. It will take roughly an hour to reach the Old Man of Stoer. Standing on the mainland at the first point you reach across from the stack, there is a small steep path down, requiring some scramble that can be damp from run-off in places. There is usually a Tyrolean traverse in situ that can be used to get to the stack (in July 2022 it was tied around a boulder on the mainland with a 4-point traditional anchor on the stack). Swimming the channel (and setting up a rope traverse) is the alternative if there is no rope in place. It is possible to rock hop and wade across, around 100m north of the stack if there is a very low tide.<br><br><strong>Descent</strong>: Make a single abseil off using a pair of 60m \nropes. The intermediate belay station at 40m is hard to reach due to the\n overhang and very poorly equipped (rusting / rotting in July 2022), so \nnot recommended.","pitchInfo":"The Original Route on the Old Man of Stoer is one of a handful of so called 4 star climbs (4 stars out of 3). The route certainly has variety, exposure, a beautiful setting and an incredible abseil finish. In terms of protection, medium, large and even very large cams can be helpful for protecting parts of the route. Route finding on pitches 3 and 4 can be tricky and these are arguably the hardest parts of the climb despite the traverse on pitch one getting the hardest technical grade in guidebooks. <br><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">5a</span></strong><br>Climb up a couple of moves and then traverse left around the base of the stack using one small horizontal break for feet and a bigger horizontal break for hands. Reach a comfortable ledge just out of sight of the start of the route, a belay can be set up here at the base of the slab. <br><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">12m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4a</span></strong><br>Climb up the slab, trending right at the top to create a belay on the next large ledge. <br><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4b</span></strong><br> Make bold moves up steep ground either directly above the belay point or using the right trending grove, then moving left again at the break. After this move up and left to another ledge. This is the belay point for the Diamond Face Route. From here there is a wedged boulder above, pass this on the right side to make a belay in the cave on top of the wedged boulder. <br><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">10m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">4c</span></strong><br> Start the pitch traversing easily right around the corner before trending up and right. From a small ledge make some hard moves to gain a bigger ledge / niche where the final belay can be made. Guidebooks seem to suggest traversing further right to create a belay on a smaller ledge. This would mean the final pitch climbs the chimney directly above the small belay ledge.  <br><strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 5 –<span class=\"length\">15m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\">3c</span></strong><br> Move up and diagonally right to one large edge, then up onto another. From here take the left slanting slab to the summit plateau.","incline":"Vertical","face":"SE","abseil":1,"traverse":1,"boat":null,"tidal":1,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2022-11-10T12:55:24.871Z","weatherData":{"rainyDays":[20,17,20,16,15,14,15,17,17,20,19,17],"tempH":[8,7,8,9,11,13,15,15,14,12,10,8],"tempL":[5,5,5,6,8,10,12,13,11,9,7,6]},"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/stoer/maps/","alt":"The Old Man of Stoer's Location in Scotland"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/stoer/old-man-of-stoer-original-route-climb.jpg","alt":"Topo for The Old Man of Stoer Original Route","atributionURL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","attributionText":"Our own image","dataFile":5},"referances":[{"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106636010/the-old-man-of-stoer","text":"Climb Info: Mountain Project Page"},{"url":"https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=300","text":"Climb Info: UKC Page"},{"url":"https://www.multi-pitch.com/img/topos/stoer/belay-position-on-stoer-sea-stack.jpg","text":"Climb Image: Climber on better penultimate belay.
