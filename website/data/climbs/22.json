Most of the routes are bolted but a small rack is more or less essential. Diedro UBSA is one of the more popular climbs on the face and provides a long winding adventure including an 8 meter abseil at one point in order to progress the route to the top. The rock is loose in places so remember your helmet. Pleanty of water is also recomended due to the heat you can get on the south face.","approach":"Peñón is the obvious land mark you see from Calpe. It should also be well signposted. If you drive to the harbour you can park there and take a short walkaround the and scramble up to the start of this rout on the south face. From the summit there should be a path down through the mountain.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab & Vertical","face":"S","abseil":1,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-04-09T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":4,"Feb":3,"Mar":4,"Apr":4,"May":4,"Jun":2,"Jul":1,"Aug":1,"Sep":3,"Oct":4,"Nov":4,"Dec":4},{"type":"tempH","Jan":15,"Feb":16,"Mar":18,"Apr":19,"May":23,"Jun":27,"Jul":29,"Aug":29,"Sep":27,"Oct":24,"Nov":18,"Dec":16},{"type":"tempL","Jan":6,"Feb":6,"Mar":8,"Apr":10,"May":13,"Jun":17,"Jul":20,"Aug":21,"Sep":18,"Oct":14,"Nov":9,"Dec":7}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/penon/maps/","alt":"Costa Blanca climbing location","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"38.633896,0.074286"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/penon/penon-topo-for-diedre-UBSA.jpg","alt":"Diedro UBSA topo on the south face near Calpe","atributionURL":"https://verticalfever.co.uk/2013/10/24/costa-blanca-round-up/","attributionText":"original: vertical fever","dataFile":null},"referances":[],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9781873341954","title":"Costa Blanca","type":"guidebook","pg":267,"description":"A brilliant book covering a wide and varied set of crags in sunny Spain.
