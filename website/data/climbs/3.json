There is only one technically demanding section up an often-damp corner. The route is long with a lot of variation possible.","approach":"From Llanberis either take Britain's only Rack and Pinion Railway to the Halfway House, or make the walk from Llanberis. Walk up the road opposite the Royal Victoria Hotel, then take the path left which runs parallel with the Snowdon Mountain Railway. After the Halfway House a miner's path breaks off right to coast beneath the crag and above picturesque Llyn Du'r Arddu. Beware of rock fall. Calculate 2 hours for the walk-in.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab","face":"N","abseil":null,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":1,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2021-10-15T01:01:42.339Z","weatherData":{"rainyDays":[13,10,11,9,8,8,8,9,10,14,14,14],"tempH":[8,8,9,12,15,17,19,18,17,13,10,8],"tempL":[3,2,3,4,7,10,12,12,10,8,5,3]},"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/cloggy/maps/","alt":"Map showing the location of the great slab on Cloggy"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/cloggy/cloggy-topo-for-great-slab.jpg","alt":"The Great Slab Topo on Clogwyn Dur Arddu","atributionURL":"https://www.thebmc.co.uk/zoomtopo/cloggy/","attributionText":"BMC super zoom","dataFile":5},"references":[{"url":"https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=457","text":"Clogwyn Du'r Arddu on UKC"},{"url":"https://www.thebmc.co.uk/zoomtopo/cloggy/","text":"BMC Supper Zoom topo of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu"},{"url":"https://www.rockfax.com/wp-content/uploads/intros/north-wales-climbs-preview.pdf","text":"Rockfax preview covering the Great Slab climb on Cloggy"}],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9781873341827","title":"North Wales Climbs","type":"guidebook","pg":149,"description":"If you could only own one book on multi-pitch climbing in the UK this book would be a great choice.
