It's both polished and popular, but for a reason. The exposure and views are incredible and the climbing sits firmly at the easier end of the scale with a grade of UIAA IV+. The is a mountain refuge nearby but it’s over an hours hike to get here.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: There is a shuttle bus that runs between Pera in the Val di Fassa and Rufugio Gardenccia (approach time is measured from Rufugio Gardenccia [Gardenccia shelter/mountain refuge]). The service departs from the large carpark by the Ciampedie chairlift in Pera. From here hike to the Rufugio Re Alberto, then follow the well worn path to the towers. Take the path behind Torre Piaz until reaching the gully between the larger towers of Stabeler and Delago. The rout starts from the ledge.</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: From the east edge of Delago, make a 40m abseil to a notch between the two larger towers (Stabeler and Delago). Make another 40 then 45m abseil to the base of the gully between the towers to the ledge the route started on. From here you can hike back.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab & Vertical","face":"SW","abseil":1,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":null,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-10-31T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":9,"Feb":7,"Mar":10,"Apr":10,"May":12,"Jun":14,"Jul":15,"Aug":14,"Sep":10,"Oct":7,"Nov":9,"Dec":9},{"type":"tempH","Jan":-7,"Feb":-4,"Mar":2,"Apr":5,"May":10,"Jun":14,"Jul":16,"Aug":15,"Sep":10,"Oct":4,"Nov":-3,"Dec":-7},{"type":"tempL","Jan":-18,"Feb":-15,"Mar":-11,"Apr":-7,"May":-3,"Jun":0,"Jul":2,"Aug":2,"Sep":-2,"Oct":-7,"Nov":-13,"Dec":-17}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/vejolet/maps/","alt":"Location of the Vejolet Towers","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"46.460408,11.624514"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/vejolet/vejolet-towers-piaz-arete-delagokante-topo.jpg","alt":"The Vejolet Towers topo for Piaz Arete","atributionURL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vajolett%C3%BCrme_W.JPG","attributionText":"original: Svíčková","dataFile":5},"referances":[],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9781873341971","title":"The Dolomites, Rock Climbs and Via Ferrata","type":"guidebook","pg":86,"description":"This guide covers everything you need for a multi-pitch climbing trip regardless of ability, it also has sport, trad and via ferrata routes.
