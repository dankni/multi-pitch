Indefatigable slab offering around 300m of climbing. There is little to no fixed protection but plenty of opportunity for placements all the way. Belays can be made at various positions allowing pitches to be the full length of the rope. Carrying extra gear and bringing longer ropes could speed up the climb but it’s certainly not essential. The rock is generally very solid with excellent friction but like all large mountain slabs there will be some loose rock in places. \r\n\r\nThe new guidebook Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West, grades the route 5.8. but if needed it’s possible to avoid any challenging bits by traversing into the slab. This drops the grade a little. It’s often considered 5.6 on the YDS scale which is somewhere around Severe or Hard Severe.","approach":"Hike across the dam and follow the main hikers trail that parallels he lake. Do not go up past the bear closure sign on the summit trail. The approach trail is pretty flat all the way to the scree slope when the route becomes very apparent. Don't follow any smaller offshoot trails that head downhill to the lakeshore, just follow the signs with hiker symbols on them. It's pretty straightforward. 25 minutes to scree slope from car. Head up the scree to the base of the route.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab","face":null,"abseil":null,"traverse":null,"boat":null,"tidal":null,"polished":null,"loose":1,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-10-26T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":9,"Feb":7,"Mar":9,"Apr":9,"May":11,"Jun":13,"Jul":13,"Aug":11,"Sep":9,"Oct":6,"Nov":8,"Dec":7},{"type":"tempH","Jan":-10,"Feb":-6,"Mar":-3,"Apr":-2,"May":2,"Jun":12,"Jul":15,"Aug":14,"Sep":9,"Oct":5,"Nov":-4,"Dec":-10},{"type":"tempL","Jan":-15,"Feb":-11,"Mar":-8,"Apr":-8,"May":-3,"Jun":5,"Jul":7,"Aug":7,"Sep":3,"Oct":-1,"Nov":-8,"Dec":-14}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/indefatigable/maps/","alt":"Location of Indefatigable in Canada","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"50.637466,-115.167377"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/indefatigable/joy-climb-mount-indefatigable-topo.jpg","alt":"Mount Indefatigable topo for Joy route in Canada","atributionURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Indefatigable","attributionText":"original: wikipedia","dataFile":5},"referances":[{"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/107186623/joy","text":"Mountain Project Page"}],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9780986519109","title":"Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West","type":"guidebook","pg":327,"description":"The Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West guide documents more than 1200 rock climbs across Western Canada, and in full-colour brings together into a single collection the best climbs in Western Canada, from Squamish to Lake Louise, to the Ghost River Valley.
