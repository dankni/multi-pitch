Expect a long day our for this adventure! The route takes the landward facing ridge to the summit. You will need a small boat or canoe to get to the base and ideally a very calm sea in order to make a reasonably safe crossing. Expect a complicated descent requiring some down climbing and abseiling.","approach":"Drive the 22 kilometre c class laneway from Ardara to the road end at An Port, the gateway to Irelands last great wilderness. Fom here on foot, follow the clifftop path for approx 2 kilometre to an outstanding viewpoint overlooking Glenlough Bay, Irelands largest raised shingle storm beach. From this viewpoint descend the very steep grass/scree slope for 200 or so metres and abseil from the two peg belay to the Entrance to Shambala storm beach. From the beach it is a 125 meter sea passage to the base of the stack.","pitchInfo":null,"incline":"Slab","face":"E","abseil":1,"traverse":null,"boat":1,"tidal":1,"polished":null,"loose":1,"seepage":null,"grassLegdes":null,"lastUpdate":"2019-04-09T12:00:00.000Z","weatherData":[{"type":"rainyDays","Jan":19,"Feb":15,"Mar":16,"Apr":13,"May":13,"Jun":13,"Jul":15,"Aug":16,"Sep":15,"Oct":17,"Nov":19,"Dec":18},{"type":"tempH","Jan":8,"Feb":8,"Mar":10,"Apr":12,"May":15,"Jun":17,"Jul":18,"Aug":18,"Sep":16,"Oct":13,"Nov":10,"Dec":9},{"type":"tempL","Jan":2,"Feb":2,"Mar":3,"Apr":5,"May":7,"Jun":10,"Jul":12,"Aug":12,"Sep":10,"Oct":8,"Nov":5,"Dec":3}],"mapImg":{"url":"img/topos/cnoc/maps/","alt":"Map showing the location of the Tormore Sea Stacks","atributionURL":"https://www.mapbox.com/","attributionText":"Mapbox","geo":"54.761240,-8.691597"},"topo":{"url":"img/topos/cnoc/cnoc-na-mara-route-topo.jpg","alt":"Cnoc Na Mara Route Topography","atributionURL":"https://uniqueascent.ie/cnoc_na_mara","attributionText":"Credit Iain Miller","dataFile":null},"referances":[{"url":"https://uniqueascent.ie/cnoc_na_mara","text":"Cnoc Na Mara by Iain Miller (first ascensionist)"}],"guideBooks":[{"isbn":"9780902940994","title":"Rock Climbing in Donegal","type":"guidebook","pg":80,"description":"A very comprehensive guide to Climbing Irelands North West County of Donegal.
