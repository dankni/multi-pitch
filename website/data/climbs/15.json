It's a 4-6 pitch route in which the harder sections are mainly off-width and hand-cracks with a few spots of chimney. Don't forget to register at the Visitor's Center before the climb or you risk a fine. This is a crowded route so get on super early or be ready to follow others and possibly do the abseil descent in the dark with headtorches.","approach":"<strong>Approch</strong>: Follow Tower Trail to the right until the historic wooden ladder \"viewing tubes\".
