It offers a variety of traditional multi-pitch climbs that tend to be around 3 or 4 pitches in length to reach that summit via just over 100 meters of climbing. Whilst Tenerife has a lot of incredible climbing the majority of it is single pitch sport routes. El Catedral offers some of the best trad multi-pitch climbing on the island.  In order to climb there, you need to seek permission from the national park which seems to be a straightforward process (see links in references section below). The route Via Mendez & Guillermo is not the original route up the face but offers a high quality adventure at grade UIAA V+. Whilst a completely different grading system it sits around VS. There are easier options to the summit if needed like the original route which is graded UIAA IV or around VDiff in British grades.","approach":"<strong>Approach</strong>: There is limited parking at Parador del Teide which is a short walk away. Alternatively, there are coach services up to here in the national park. The Cathedral rock climbing is south West past Roques de García.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<strong>Descent</strong>: The Decent requires 2 two abseils. Once from the top of the route, the other off to the side which can be tricky to find.
