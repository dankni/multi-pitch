        "intro": "The Ordinary Route is the easiest route on the Idwal Slabs, that is however, assuming you manage to stay on route. It represents an ideal introduction to trad multi-pitch climbing. It is also possible to bring up someone with limited climbing experience in a group of 3, but the Descent can prove tricky, especially in wet conditions. Expect some polish on the route as well. The views are stunning, don't underestimate the stamina required despite the easy technical grade.",
        "approach": "Take the main path from Ogwen Cottage to Llyn Idwal and continue around the left-hand side of the lake towards the slabs which are straight ahead of you. Any attempt at a shortcut will likley slow you down. Descent can prove tricky, especially in wet conditions. From the last picth, scramble across the crag up and left (stay ropped if with beginners) then downclimb or abseil off the back corner of the cliff.",
        "pitchInfo": "First climbed in 1897 the Ordinary Route is the easiest climb up the Idwal slabs. That said the route Hope is not much more challenging. The Ordinary Route offers a good introduction to multi-pitch climbing, and as such it’s often a busy climb and used by guides quite a lot. Unless it’s raining the slabs at Cwm Idwal can be busy. Climbers can ascend this route in bad weather if they are brave.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 1 –<span class=\"length\">45m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br>\r\nFollow the obvious crack to a wedged block and either belay there or on a better ledge above. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 2 –<span class=\"length\">45m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br>\r\nAfter the belay, take the left hand grove working up and left slightly before following a long rightwards leaning line of weakness up to some ledges where another belay can be made. \r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 3 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br>\r\nFollow the crack up towards a ledge, the route becomes much less clear here with multiple options for creating an anchor. Ideally take the easiest climbing.\r\n<br />\r\n<strong class=\"pitch-title\">Pitch 4 –<span class=\"length\">25m</span> <span class=\"pitchGrade brit\"></span></strong><br>\r\nThe final official pitch goes left for about 8m then up and right towards a much larger ledge system. A shorter, slightly harder and more direct line can be taken. After this there is a reasonable amount of scrambling left and then up to get to the downclimb or abseil. Instead of the scramble, climbers can continue up on the harder continuation wall. This will add more length to this route at a higher grade. Lazarus to the far right is the easiest and arguably best way up if you want to continue with harder climbing.",

The route is exceptional and mostly quite straightforward. 5 pitches are the norm and running together the middle pitches can cause ropework issues around the cracked corner section. The route is climbable in rain, although it will mean having to make anchor points in a small waterfall, which is not recommend and likely very unsafe. The line was originally thought impenetrable by the top climbers of the time like O.G. Jones. This route was first climbed by Emily Hilda Daniell in 1915 and named Minerva.
